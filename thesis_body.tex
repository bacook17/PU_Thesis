\title{Keep Calm and Baryon:\\The Distribution of Baryons and\\ Dark Matter on
  Cosmic Scales}
\author{Benjamin A. Cook}
\advisor{Prof. Neta Bahcall}

\abstract{We present a compilation of observational measurements of
  the distribution of baryons, relative to dark matter, in halos
  ranging in size from galaxies to massive clusters. This includes
  X-ray and SZ measurements of the hot intracluster medium (ICM) in
  groups and clusters, weak lensing and optical constraints on the
  cluster stellar fraction, and absorption measurements of the cool
  circumgalactic medium (CGM) in galactic halos. Using direct
  observations when possible, and extrapolations of observed density
  profiles when necessary, we show that the baryon content within the
  virial radius matches the cosmic baryon fraction ($0.164\pm0.004$)
  for halos ranging over three orders of magnitude in mass. The baryon
  distribution is more centrally concentrated in high-mass halos, and
  more extended in low-mass halos. Using the ratio of stellar
  fractions in galaxies and clusters, we place a lower limit of $40\%$
  on the contributions of individual galaxy halos to the dark matter
  and baryonic mass of clusters. Averaged on scales larger than the
  virial radius, the baryonic mass is a strong tracer of the
  underlying dark matter distribution, and can be useful as a tool in
  cosmological studies of structure formation.}
