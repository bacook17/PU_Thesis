\title{Keep Calm and Baryon:\\The Distribution of Baryons and\\ Dark Matter on
  Cosmic Scales}
\author{Benjamin A. Cook}
\advisor{Prof. Neta Bahcall}

\abstract{We present a compilation of observational measurements of
  the distribution of baryons, relative to dark matter, in halos
  ranging in size from galaxies to massive clusters. This includes
  X-ray and SZ measurements of the hot intracluster medium (ICM) in
  groups and clusters, weak lensing and optical constraints on the
  cluster stellar fraction, and absorption measurements of the cool
  circumgalactic medium (CGM) in galactic halos. Using direct
  observations when possible, and extrapolations of observed density
  profiles when necessary, we show that the baryon content within the
  virial radius matches the cosmic baryon fraction ($0.164\pm0.004$)
  for halos ranging over three orders of magnitude in mass. The baryon
  distribution is more centrally concentrated in high-mass halos, and
  more extended in low-mass halos. Using the ratio of stellar
  fractions in galaxies and clusters, we place a lower limit of $40\%$
  on the contributions of individual galaxy halos to the dark matter
  and baryonic mass of clusters. Averaged on scales larger than the
  virial radius, the baryonic mass is a strong tracer of the
  underlying dark matter distribution, and can be useful as a tool in
  cosmological studies of structure formation.}

\acknowledgements{First and foremost, I would like to thank Neta
  Bahcall for her wonderful support and guidance throughout this
  project, my graduate application process, and my entire Princeton
  career. She is an inspiration and invaluable mentor to every student
  in astrophysics and made me feel welcome in the department from my
  first day on campus. I'm very glad to have gotten the chance to
  conclude my senior year by working with her on this project, and I
  look forward to collaborating more on it in the future. I would
  like to thank Professor J.~Xavier Prochaska, Professor Lars
  Hernquist, and Dr.~Shy Genel for their discussions and insight into
  their work. I would also like to thank Dr.~Renyue Cen for making his
  simulations available for my analysis, which I regret I was not able
  to include in this thesis. Thank you to Tomer, Michael, Fred,
  and all the astro undergrads for the great times studying and
  working together in Peyton. Thank you to Shelby for believing in
  me, for giving me a reason to try harder and reach my full
  potential, and for always lifting my spirits when work is
  overwhelming. Finally, I would like to thank my parents, Kelly
  and Tom, for their love and encouragement and for giving me the
  opportunity to make it where I am today.}

\dedication{Dedicated to my brother, Walter.\\I'm very proud of you, and know you will
  accomplish amazing things.\\Continue to challenge
  yourself, and I'll enjoy my headstart while it lasts.}
