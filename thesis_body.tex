\title{Keep Calm and Baryon: The Distribution of Baryons and Dark Matter on
  Cosmic Scales}
\author{Benjamin A. Cook}
\advisor{Prof. Neta Bahcall}

\abstract{We present a compilation of observational constraints on the
  distribution of baryons, relative to dark matter, in cosmic halos
  ranging from galaxies to massive clusters. These include X-ray and
  SZ measurements of the hot intracluster medium (ICM) in groups and
  clusters, weak lensing and optical constraints on the cluster
  stellar fraction, and absorption measurements of the cool
  circumgalactic medium (CGM) outside galaxies. Using direct
  observations when possible and extrapolations of observed density
  profiles when necessary, we show that the baryon content within the
  virial radius matches the cosmic baryon fraction ($0.164$) for halos
  ranging over three orders of magnitude in mass. The baryonic mass is
  therefore a strong tracer of the underlying dark matter
  distribution, and can be used as a tool in cosmological studies of
  structure formation, although baryons are more extended beyond the
  virial radius in low-mass halos. Using the ratio of stellar
  fractions in galaxies and clusters, we place a lower limit of $40\%$
  on the contributions of individual galaxy halos to the dark matter
  and baryonic mass of clusters.}
