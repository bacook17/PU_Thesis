A summary of information about the several sources of gas fraction data.

1) Rasheed et al. 2010
bibcode: 2010arXiv1007.1980R
h = 0.72
Redshift range: 0.012 -> 0.23
Mass range: M500 h_72^-1 => 0.3 - 10 (E14 M_solar)
Mass bins: 0.3 - 0.7 
     	   0.7 - 1.7
	   1.7 - 4.2
	   4.2 - 10. 
Rvir defined as R_100
Overdensities defined as versus critical, not background
*Fg_500 are averages from Chandra and XMM observations
Fg_500 data originally from Giodini et al. 2009 (2009ApJ...703..982G)
*Paper uses mean observed gas and mass density profiles to extrapolate Fg
These density profiles are observed out to Rvir and beyond (not extrapolations themselves)
Hydrostatic equilibrium is assumed for Fg_500 (needs correction)
*Total cluster mass is calculated from Lx vs. M relation, calibrated against Weak Lensing (!)


2) Planck Collaboration Intermediate Results V
bibcode: 2013A&A...550A.131P
Also used Corrigendum: 2013A&A...558C...2P
h = 0.70
Redshift range: 0.04 - 0.4
Mass range: M500 => 2 - 15 (E14 M_solar)
Mass bins: only one
No Rvir defined
Overdensities defined as versus critical
*Fg calculated as follows:
    Gas pressure derived from SZ measurements
    Gas temperature derived from X-ray observations
    Total mass appoximated using M500 and NFW profile
*Temp only measured to 1.2 R500...Two temperature assumptions made:
     H1: Extrapolate observed temp profile (Most reasonable)
     H2: Assume constant temp beyond 1.2 R500
Total mass from Yx vs. M, calibrated against hydrostatic masses
*Both total mass range and F_gas need correction for hydrostatic equil.
Corrigendum gives proper F_gas distribution
Could select arbitrarily many radii to plot, not just R500, R200, Rvir

3) Eckert et al. 2013
bibcode: 2013A&A...551A..23E
h = 0.70
Results only given at R500 and R200
*Fg calculated as follows:
    Average gas pressure profile from Planck
    Average gas density profile from ROSAT X-ray obs.
    Pressure + density -> Hydrostatic mass profile
    density -> gas mass profile
Also gives Fg for 18 ind. clusters in overlap btwn. Planck/ROSAT
Two different deprojection techniques... which one is more reasonable?
CC (relaxed) clusters show lower gas fractions than NCC
Represents a different way of getting at Fgas than Planck... Why are they different?
