abstract = {We investigate if the discrepancy between estimates of the total baryon mass fraction obtained from observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and of galaxy groups/clusters persists when a large sample of groups is considered. To this purpose, 91 candidate X-ray groups/poor clusters at redshift 0.1 < z < 1 are selected from the COSMOS 2 deg\^{}2 survey, based only on their X-ray luminosity and extent. This sample is complemented by 27 nearby clusters with a robust, analogous determination of the total and stellar mass inside R\_500. The total sample of 118 groups and clusters with z < 1 spans a range in M\_500 of \~{}10\^{}13--10\^{}15 M\_sun. We find that the stellar mass fraction associated with galaxies at R\_500 decreases with increasing total mass as (M\_500)\^{}-0.37 $\backslash$pm 0.04, independent of redshift. Estimating the total gas mass fraction from a recently derived, high quality scaling relation, the total baryon mass fraction (f\_500\^{}stars+gas=f\_500\^{}stars+f\_500\^{}gas) is found to increase by \~{} 25\% when M\_500 increases from <M>=5 X 10\^{}13 M\_sun to <M> = 7 X 10\^{}14 M\_sun. After consideration of a plausible contribution due to intra--cluster light (11--22\% of the total stellar mass), and gas depletion through the hierarchical assembly process (10\% of the gas mass), the estimated values of the total baryon mass fraction are still lower than the latest CMB measure of the same quantity (WMAP5), at a significance level of 3.3$\backslash$sigma for groups of <M>=5 X 10\^{}13\~{}M\_sun. The discrepancy decreases towards higher total masses, such that it is 1$\backslash$sigma at <M>= 7 X 10\^{}14\~{}M\_sun. We discuss this result in terms of non--gravitational processes such as feedback and filamentary heating.},

abstract = {We present the equivalent width and column density measurements for low and intermediate ionization states of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding 44 low-z, L ≈ L* galaxies drawn from the COS-Halos survey. These measurements are derived from far-UV transitions observed in HST/COS and Keck/HIRES spectra of background quasars within an impact parameter R < 160 kpc to the targeted galaxies. The data show significant metal-line absorption for 33 of the 44 galaxies, including quiescent systems, revealing the common occurrence of a cool (T ≈ 104-105 K), metal-enriched CGM. The detection rates and column densities derived for these metal lines decrease with increasing impact parameter, a trend we interpret as a declining metal surface density profile for the CGM. A comparison of the relative column densities of adjacent ionization states indicates that the gas is predominantly ionized. The large surface density in metals demands a large reservoir of metals and gas in the cool CGM (very conservatively, M cool CGM > 109 M ⊙), which likely traces a distinct density and/or temperature regime from the highly ionized CGM traced by O+5 absorption. The large dispersion in absorption strengths (including non-detections) suggests that the cool CGM traces a wide range of densities or a mix of local ionizing conditions. Lastly, the kinematics inferred from the metal-line profiles are consistent with the cool CGM being bound to the dark matter halos hosting the galaxies; this gas may serve as fuel for future star formation. Future work will leverage this data set to provide estimates on the mass, metallicity, dynamics, and origin of the cool CGM in low-z, L* galaxies.},

@article{Reese2012,
abstract = {We present follow-up observations with the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Array (SZA) of optically-confirmed galaxy clusters found in the equatorial survey region of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT): ACT-CL J0022-0036, ACT-CL J2051+0057, and ACT-CL J2337+0016. ACT-CL J0022-0036 is a newly-discovered, massive (10\^{}15 Msun), high-redshift (z=0.81) cluster revealed by ACT through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE). Deep, targeted observations with the SZA allow us to probe a broader range of cluster spatial scales, better disentangle cluster decrements from radio point source emission, and derive more robust integrated SZE flux and mass estimates than we can with ACT data alone. For the two clusters we detect with the SZA we compute integrated SZE signal and derive masses from the SZA data only. ACT-CL J2337+0016, also known as Abell 2631, has archival Chandra data that allow an additional X-ray-based mass estimate. Optical richness is also used to estimate cluster masses and shows good agreement with the SZE and X-ray-based estimates. Based on the point sources detected by the SZA in these three cluster fields and an extrapolation to ACT's frequency, we estimate that point sources could be contaminating the SZE decrement at the <= 20\% level for some fraction of clusters.},

abstract = {We analyze the association of galaxies to Lya and OVI absorption, the most commonly detected transitions in the low-z intergalactic medium (IGM), in the fields of 14 quasars with z\_em = 0.06-0.57. Confirming previous studies, we observe a high covering fraction for Lya absorption to impact parameter rho = 300kpc: 33/37 of our L>0.01L* galaxies show Lya equivalent width W\_Lya>50mA. Galaxies of all luminosity L>0.01L* and spectral type are surrounded by a diffuse and ionized circumgalactic medium (CGM), whose baryonic mass is estimated at \~{}10\^{}(10.5 +/- 0.3) Msun for a constant N\_H. The virialized halos and extended CGM of present-day galaxies are responsible for most strong Lya absorbers (W\_Lya > 300mA) but cannot reproduce the majority of observed lines in the Lya forest. We conclude that the majority of Lya absorption with W\_Lya=30-300mA occurs in the cosmic web predicted by cosmological simulations and estimate a characteristic width for these filaments of \~{}400kpc. Regarding OVI, we observe a near unity covering fraction to rho=200kpc for L>0.1L* galaxies and to rho = 300kpc for sub-L* (0.1 L*<L<L*) galaxies. Similar to our Lya results, stronger OVI systems (W\_OVI > 70mA) arise in the virialized halos of L>0.1L* galaxies. Unlike Lya, the weaker OVI systems (W\_OVI\~{}30mA) arise in the extended CGM of sub-L* galaxies. The majority of OVI gas observed in the low-z IGM is associated with a diffuse medium surrounding individual galaxies with L\~{}0.3L*, and rarely originates in the so-called warm-hot IGM (WHIM) predicted by cosmological simulations.},

abstract = {The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is fed by galaxy outflows and accretion of intergalactic gas, but its mass, heavy element enrichment, and relation to galaxy properties are poorly constrained by observations. In a survey of the outskirts of 42 galaxies with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope, we detected ubiquitous, large (150-kiloparsec) halos of ionized oxygen surrounding star-forming galaxies; we found much less ionized oxygen around galaxies with little or no star formation. This ionized CGM contains a substantial mass of heavy elements and gas, perhaps far exceeding the reservoirs of gas in the galaxies themselves. Our data indicate that it is a basic component of nearly all star-forming galaxies that is removed or transformed during the quenching of star formation and the transition to passive evolution.},

abstract = {We present the optical and X-ray properties of 68 galaxy clusters selected via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect at 148 GHz by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Our sample, from an area of 504 square degrees centered on the celestial equator, is divided into two regions. The main region uses 270 square degrees of the ACT survey that overlaps with the co-added ugriz imaging from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) over Stripe 82 plus additional near-infrared pointed observations with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5-meter telescope. We confirm a total of 49 clusters to z\~{}1.3, of which 22 (all at z>0.55) are new discoveries. For the second region the regular-depth SDSS imaging allows us to confirm 19 more clusters up to z\~{}0.7, of which 10 systems are new. We present the optical richness, photometric redshifts, and separation between the SZ position and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We find no significant offset between the cluster SZ centroid and BCG location and a weak correlation between optical richness and SZ-derived mass. We also present X-ray fluxes and luminosities from the ROSAT All Sky Survey which confirm that this is a massive sample. One of the newly discovered clusters, ACT-CL J0044.4+0113 at z=1.1 (photometric), has an integrated XMM-Newton X-ray temperature of kT\_x=7.9+/-1.0 keV and combined mass of M\_200a=8.2(-2.5,+3.3)x10\^{}14 M\_sun/h70 placing it among the most massive and X-ray-hot clusters known at redshifts beyond z=1. We also highlight the optically-rich cluster ACT-CL J2327.4-0204 (RCS2 2327) at z=0.705 (spectroscopic) as the most significant detection of the whole equatorial sample with a Chandra-derived mass of M\_200a=1.9(-0.4,+0.6)x10\^{}15 M\_sun/h70, comparable to some of the most massive known clusters like "El Gordo" and the Bullet Cluster.},

abstract = {We present a systematic analysis of 43 nearby galaxy groups (kT 500 = 0.7-2.7 keV or M 500 = 1013-1014 h -1 M sun, 0.012 <z< 0.12), based on Chandra archival data. With robust background subtraction and modeling, we trace gas properties to at least r 2500 for all 43 groups. For 11 groups, gas properties can be robustly derived to r 500. For an additional 12 groups, we derive gas properties to at least r 1000 and estimate properties at r 500 from extrapolation. We show that in spite of the large variation in temperature profiles inside 0.15 r 500, the temperature profiles of these groups are similar at > 0.15 r 500 and are consistent with a "universal temperature profile." We present the K-T relations at six characteristic radii (30 kpc, 0.15 r 500, r 2500, r 1500, r 1000, and r 500), for 43 groups from this work and 14 clusters from the Vikhlinin et al. (2008) sample. Despite large scatter in the entropy values at 30 kpc and 0.15 r 500, the intrinsic scatter at r 2500 is much smaller and remains the same (\~{} 10\%) to r 500. The entropy excess at r 500 is confirmed, in both groups and clusters, but the magnitude is smaller than previous ROSAT and ASCA results. We also present scaling relations for the gas fraction. It appears that the average gas fraction between r 2500 and r 500 has no temperature dependence, \~{} 0.12 for 1-10 keV systems. The group gas fractions within r 2500 are generally low and have large scatter. This work shows that the difference of groups from hotter clusters stems from the difficulty of compressing group gas inside of r 2500. The large scatter of the group gas fraction within r 2500 causes large scatter in the group entropy around the center and may be responsible for the large scatter of the group luminosities. Nevertheless, the groups appear more regular and more like clusters beyond r 2500 from the results on gas fraction and entropy. Therefore, mass proxies can be extended into low-mass systems. The M 500-T 500 and M 500-Y X,500 relations derived in this work are indeed well behaved down to at least 2 ×1013 h-1 M sun.},

abstract = {We present radial entropy profiles of the intracluster medium (ICM) for a collection of 239 clusters taken from the Chandra X-ray Observatory's Data Archive. Entropy is of great interest because it controls ICM global properties and records the thermal history of a cluster. Entropy is therefore a useful quantity for studying the effects of feedback on the cluster environment and investigating any breakdown of cluster self-similarity. We find that most ICM entropy profiles are well fitted by a model which is a power law at large radii and approaches a constant value at small radii: K(r) = K 0 + K 100(r/100 kpc)$\alpha$, where K 0 quantifies the typical excess of core entropy above the best-fitting power law found at larger radii. We also show that the K 0 distributions of both the full archival sample and the primary Highest X-Ray Flux Galaxy Cluster Sample of Reiprich (2001) are bimodal with a distinct gap between K 0 ≈ 30-50 keV cm2 and population peaks at K 0 \~{} 15 keV cm2 and K 0 \~{} 150 keV cm2. The effects of point-spread function smearing and angular resolution on best-fit K 0 values are investigated using mock Chandra observations and degraded entropy profiles, respectively. We find that neither of these effects is sufficient to explain the entropy-profile flattening we measure at small radii. The influence of profile curvature and number of radial bins on best-fit K 0 is also considered, and we find no indication that K 0 is significantly impacted by either. For completeness, we include previously unpublished optical spectroscopy of H$\alpha$ and [N II] emission lines discussed in Cavagnolo et al. (2008a). All data and results associated with this work are publicly available via the project Web site.},

abstract = {We present a first measurement of the stellar mass component of galaxy clusters selected via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, using 3.6 um and 4.5 um photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope. Our sample consists of 14 clusters detected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), which span the redshift range 0.27 < z < 1.07 (median z = 0.50), and have dynamical mass measurements, accurate to about 30 per cent, with median M500 = 6.9 x 10\^{}\{14\} MSun. We measure the 3.6 um and 4.5 um galaxy luminosity functions, finding the characteristic magnitude (m*) and faint-end slope (alpha) to be similar to those for IR-selected cluster samples. We perform the first measurements of the scaling of SZ-observables (Y500 and y0) with both brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) stellar mass and total cluster stellar mass (M500star). We find a significant correlation between BCG stellar mass and Y500 (E(z)\^{}\{-2/3\} DA\^{}2 Y500 \~{} M*\^{}\{1.2 +/- 0.6\}), although we are not able to obtain a strong constraint on the slope of the relation due to the small sample size. Additionally, we obtain E(z)\^{}\{-2/3\} DA\^{}2 Y500 \~{} M500star\^{}\{1.0 +/- 0.6\} for the scaling with total stellar mass. The mass fraction in stars spans the range 0.006-0.034, with the second ranked cluster in terms of dynamical mass (ACT-CL J0237-4939) having an unusually low total stellar mass and the lowest stellar mass fraction. For the five clusters with gas mass measurements available in the literature, we see no evidence for a shortfall of baryons relative to the cosmic mean value.},

abstract = {The South Pole Telescope (SPT) is currently surveying 2500 deg\^{}2 of the southern sky to detect massive galaxy clusters out to the epoch of their formation using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. This paper presents a catalog of the 26 most significant SZ cluster detections in the full survey region. The catalog includes 14 clusters which have been previously identified and 12 that are new discoveries. These clusters were identified in fields observed to two differing noise depths: 1500 deg\^{}2 at the final SPT survey depth of 18 uK-arcmin at 150 GHz, and 1000 deg\^{}2 at a depth of 54 uK-arcmin. Clusters were selected on the basis of their SZ signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in SPT maps, a quantity which has been demonstrated to correlate tightly with cluster mass. The S/N thresholds were chosen to achieve a comparable mass selection across survey fields of both depths. Cluster redshifts were obtained with optical and infrared imaging and spectroscopy from a variety of ground- and space-based facilities. The redshifts range from 0.098 $\backslash$leq z $\backslash$leq 1.132 with a median of z\_med = 0.40. The measured SZ S/N and redshifts lead to unbiased mass estimates ranging from 9.8 $\backslash$times 10\^{}14 M\_sun/h\_70 $\backslash$leq M\_200(rho\_mean) $\backslash$leq 3.1 $\backslash$times 10\^{}15 M\_sun/h\_70. Based on the SZ mass estimates, we find that none of the clusters are individually in significant tension with the LambdaCDM cosmological model. We also test for evidence of non-Gaussianity based on the cluster sample and find the data show no preference for non-Gaussian perturbations.},

abstract = {How much dark matter is there in the universe and where is it located? These are two of the most fundamental questions in cosmology. We use in this paper optical and x-ray mass determinations of galaxies, groups, and clusters of galaxies to suggest that most of the dark matter may reside in very large halos around galaxies, typically extending to \~{}200 kpc for bright galaxies. We show that the mass-to-light ratio of galaxy systems does not increase significantly with linear scale beyond the very large halos suggested for individual galaxies. Rather, the total mass of large scale systems such as groups and rich clusters of galaxies, even superclusters, can on average be accounted for by the total mass of their member galaxies, including their large halos (which may be stripped-off in the dense cluster environment but still remain in the clusters) plus the mass of the hot intracluster gas. This conclusion also suggests that we may live in a low-density universe with Omega \~{} 0.2 - 0.3.},

abstract = {Observations of clusters of galaxies suggest that they contain significantly fewer baryons (gas plus stars) than the cosmic baryon fraction. This `missing baryon' puzzle is especially surprising for the most massive clusters which are expected to be representative of the cosmic matter content of the universe (baryons and dark matter). Here we show that the baryons may not actually be missing from clusters, but rather are extended to larger radii than typically observed. The baryon deficiency is typically observed in the central regions of clusters (\~{}0.5 the virial radius). However, the observed gas-density profile is significantly shallower than the mass-density profile, implying that the gas is more extended than the mass and that the gas fraction increases with radius. We use the observed density profiles of gas and mass in clusters to extrapolate the measured baryon fraction as a function of radius and as a function of cluster mass. We find that the baryon fraction reaches the cosmic value near the virial radius for all groups and clusters above 5e13 solar masses. This suggests that the baryons are not missing, they are simply located in cluster outskirts. Heating processes (shock-heating of the intracluster gas, plus supernovae and AGN feedback) that cause the gas to expand are likely explanations for these results. Upcoming observations should be able to detect these baryons.},

abstract = {We present a catalog of 224 galaxy cluster candidates, selected through their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signature in the first 720 deg2 of the South Pole Telescope (SPT) survey. This area was mapped with the SPT in the 2008 and 2009 austral winters to a depth of 18 uK-arcmin at 150 GHz; 550 deg2 of it was also mapped to 44 uK-arcmin at 95 GHz. Based on optical imaging of all candidates and near-infrared imaging of the majority of candidates, we have found optical and/or infrared counterparts for 158 clusters. Of these, 135 were first identified as clusters in SPT data, including 117 new discoveries reported in this work. This catalog triples the number of confirmed galaxy clusters discovered through the SZ effect. We report photometrically derived (and in some cases spectroscopic) redshifts for confirmed clusters and redshift lower limits for the remaining candidates. The catalog extends to high redshift with a median redshift of z = 0.55 and maximum redshift of z = 1.37. Based on simulations, we expect the catalog to be nearly 100\% complete above M500 \~{} 5e14 Msun h\_\{70\}\^{}-1 at z > 0.6. There are 121 candidates detected at signal-to-noise greater than five, at which the catalog purity is measured to be 95\%. From this high-purity subsample, we exclude the z < 0.3 clusters and use the remaining 100 candidates to improve cosmological constraints following the method presented by Benson et al., 2011. Adding the cluster data to CMB+BAO+H0 data leads to a preference for non-zero neutrino masses while only slightly reducing the upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses to sum mnu < 0.38 eV (95\% CL). For a spatially flat wCDM cosmological model, the addition of this catalog to the CMB+BAO+H0+SNe results yields sigma8=0.807+-0.027 and w = -1.010+-0.058, improving the constraints on these parameters by a factor of 1.4 and 1.3, respectively.

abstract = {We investigate the properties of damped Ly\{$\backslash$alpha\} absorption systems (DLAs) in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation, including partitioning of cold gas in galactic discs into atomic, molecular, and ionized phases with a molecular gas-based star formation recipe. We investigate two approaches for partitioning gas into these constituents: a pressure-based and a metallicity-based recipe. We identify DLAs by passing lines of sight through our simulations to compute HI column densities. We find that models with "standard" gas radial profiles - where the average specific angular momentum of the gas disc is equal to that of the host dark matter halo - fail to reproduce the observed column density distribution of DLAs. These models also fail to reproduce the distribution of velocity widths \{$\backslash$Delta\}v, overproducing low \{$\backslash$Delta\}v relative to high \{$\backslash$Delta\}v systems. Models with "extended" radial gas profiles - corresponding to gas discs with higher specific angular momentum - are able to reproduce quite well the column density distribution of absorbers over the column density range 19 < log NHI < 22.5 in the redshift range 2 < z < 3.5. The model with pressure-based gas partitioning also reproduces the observed line density of DLAs, HI gas density, and \{$\backslash$Delta\}v distribution at z < 3 remarkably well. However all of the models investigated here underproduce DLAs and the HI gas density at z > 3. If this is the case, the flatness in the number of DLAs and HI gas density over the redshift interval 0 < z < 5 may be due to a cosmic coincidence where the majority of DLAs at z > 3 arise from intergalactic gas in filaments while those at z < 3 arise predominantly in galactic discs. We further investigate the dependence of DLA metallicity on redshift and \{$\backslash$Delta\}v, and find reasonably good agreement with the observations, particularly when including the effects of metallicity gradients (abbrv.).},

abstract = {We present South Pole Telescope (SPT) observations of the five galaxy cluster candidates in the southern hemisphere which were reported as unconfirmed in the Planck Early Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (ESZ) sample. One cluster candidate, PLCKESZ G255.62-46.16, is located in the 2500-square-degree SPT SZ survey region and was reported previously as SPT-CL J0411-4819. For the remaining four candidates, which are located outside of the SPT SZ survey region, we performed short, dedicated SPT observations. Each of these four candidates was strongly detected in maps made from these observations, with signal-to-noise ratios ranging from 6.3 to 13.8. We have observed these four candidates on the Magellan-Baade telescope and used these data to estimate cluster redshifts from the red sequence. Resulting redshifts range from 0.24 to 0.46. We report measurements of Y\_0.75', the integrated Comptonization within a 0.75' radius, for all five candidates. We also report X-ray luminosities calculated from ROSAT All-Sky Survey catalog counts, as well as optical and improved SZ coordinates for each candidate. The combination of SPT SZ measurements, optical red-sequence measurements, and X-ray luminosity estimates demonstrates that these five Planck ESZ cluster candidates do indeed correspond to real galaxy clusters with redshifts and observable properties consistent with the rest of the ESZ sample.},

abstract = {We measure the thermodynamic properties of cluster outer regions to provide constraints on the processes that rule the formation of large scale structures. We derived the thermodynamic properties of the intracluster gas (temperature, entropy) by combining the SZ thermal pressure from Planck and the X-ray gas density from ROSAT. This method allowed us to reconstruct for the first time temperature and entropy profiles out to the virial radius and beyond in a large sample of objects. At variance with several recent Suzaku studies, we find that the entropy rises steadily with radius, albeit at at a somewhat lower rate than predicted by self-similar expectations. We note significant differences between relaxed, cool-core systems and unrelaxed clusters in the outer regions. Relaxed systems appear to follow the self-similar expectations more closely than perturbed objects. Our results indicate that the well-known entropy excess observed in cluster cores extends well beyond the central regions. When correcting for the gas depletion, the observed entropy profiles agree with the prediction from gravitational collapse only, especially for cool-core clusters.},

abstract = {[Abridged] We present a catalog of 68 galaxy clusters, of which 19 are new discoveries, detected via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZ) at 148 GHz in the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) survey of 504 square degrees on the celestial equator. A subsample of 48 clusters within the 270 square degree region overlapping SDSS Stripe 82 is estimated to be 90\% complete for M\_500c > 4.5e14 Msun and 0.15 < z < 0.8. While matched filters are used to detect the clusters, the sample is studied further through a "Profile Based Amplitude Analysis" using a single filter at a fixed $\backslash$theta\_500 = 5.9' angular scale. This new approach takes advantage of the "Universal Pressure Profile" (UPP) to fix the relationship between the cluster characteristic size (R\_500) and the integrated Compton parameter (Y\_500). The UPP scalings are found to be nearly identical to an adiabatic model, while a model incorporating non-thermal pressure better matches dynamical mass measurements and masses from the South Pole Telescope. A high signal to noise ratio subsample of 15 ACT clusters is used to obtain cosmological constraints. We first confirm that constraints from SZ data are limited by uncertainty in the scaling relation parameters rather than sample size or measurement uncertainty. We next add in seven clusters from the ACT Southern survey, including their dynamical mass measurements based on galaxy velocity dispersions. In combination with WMAP7 these data simultaneously constrain the scaling relation and cosmological parameters, yielding $\backslash$sigma\_8 = 0.829 $\backslash$pm 0.024 and $\backslash$Omega\_m = 0.292 $\backslash$pm 0.025. The results include marginalization over a 15\% bias in dynamical mass relative to the true halo mass. In an extension to LCDM that incorporates non-zero neutrino mass density, we combine our data with WMAP7+BAO+Hubble constant measurements to constrain $\backslash$Sigma m\_$\backslash$nu < 0.29 eV (95\% C. L.).},

abstract = {SPT-CLJ2040-4451 -- spectroscopically confirmed at z = 1.478 -- is the highest redshift galaxy cluster yet discovered via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. SPT-CLJ2040-4451 was identified in the first 720 deg\^{}2 of the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SPT-SZ) survey, and confirmed in follow-up imaging and spectroscopy. From multi-object spectroscopy with Magellan-I/Baade+IMACS we measure spectroscopic redshifts for 15 cluster member galaxies, all of which have strong [O II] 3727 emission. SPT-CLJ2040-4451 has an SZ-measured mass of M\_500,SZ = 3.2 +/- 0.8 X 10\^{}14 M\_Sun/h\_70, corresponding to M\_200,SZ = 5.8 +/- 1.4 X 10\^{}14 M\_Sun/h\_70. The velocity dispersion measured entirely from blue star forming members is sigma\_v = 1500 +/- 520 km/s. The prevalence of star forming cluster members (galaxies with > 1.5 M\_Sun/yr) implies that this massive, high-redshift cluster is experiencing a phase of active star formation, and supports recent results showing a marked increase in star formation occurring in galaxy clusters at z >1.4. We also compute the probability of finding a cluster as rare as this in the SPT-SZ survey to be >99.5\%, indicating that its discovery is not in tension with the concordance Lambda-CDM cosmological model.},

abstract = {The hosts of luminous z \~{} 2 quasars evolve into today's massive elliptical galaxies. Current theories predict that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of these massive, dark matter halos (M DM \~{} 1012.5 M ⊙) should be dominated by a T \~{} 107 K virialized plasma. We test this hypothesis with observations of 74 close-projected quasar pairs, using spectra of the background QSO to characterize the CGM of the foreground one. Surprisingly, our measurements reveal a cool (T ≈ 104 K), massive (M CGM > 1010 M ⊙), and metal-enriched (Z >\~{} 0.1 Z ⊙) medium extending to at least the expected virial radius (r vir = 160 kpc). The average equivalent widths of H I Ly$\alpha$ ($\backslash$bar\{W\}\_Ly$\backslash$alpha = 2.1 +/- 0.15 \AA for impact parameters R < 200 kpc) and C II 1334 ($\backslash$bar\{W\}\_\{1334\} = 0.7 +/- 0.1) exceed the corresponding CGM measurements of these transitions from all galaxy populations studied previously. Furthermore, we conservatively estimate that the quasar CGM has a 64+6 -7\% covering fraction of optically thick gas (N H I > 1017.2 cm-2) within r vir; this covering factor is twice that of the contemporaneous Lyman break galaxy population. This unexpected reservoir of cool gas is rarely detected "down-the-barrel" to quasars, and hence it is likely that our background sight lines intercept gas that is shadowed from the quasar ionizing radiation by the same obscuring medium often invoked in models of active galactic nucleus unification. Because the high-z halos inhabited by quasars predate modern groups and clusters, these observations are also relevant to the formation and enrichment history of the intragroup/intracluster medium.},

abstract = {For any assumed stellar Initial Mass Function, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) gives a precise determination of the stellar mass function of galaxies for 10\^{}8 M\_sun < M\_* < 10\^{}12 M\_sun. Within the concordance LCDM cosmology, the Millennium simulations give a precise halo mass function for all halos within which galaxies can form. Under the plausible hypothesis that the stellar mass of a galaxy is an increasing function of the maximum mass ever attained by its halo, these combine to give halo mass as a function of stellar mass. The result agrees quite well with observational estimates of mean halo mass as a function of stellar mass from stacking analyses of the gravitational lensing signal and the satellite dynamics of SDSS galaxies. For M\_* \~{} 5.5 x 10\^{}10 M\_sun, the stellar mass usually assumed for the Milky Way, the implied halo mass is \~{} 2 x 10\^{}12 M\_sun, consistent with most recent direct estimates and inferences from the MW/M31 Timing Argument. The fraction of the baryons associated with each halo which are present as stars in its central galaxy reaches a maximum of 20\% at masses somewhat below that of the Milky Way, and falls rapidly at both higher and lower masses. These conversion efficiencies are lower than in almost all recent high-resolution simulations of galaxy formation, showing that these are not yet viable models for the formation of typical members of the galaxy population. When inserted in the Millennium-II Simulation, our derived relation between stellar mass and halo mass predicts a stellar mass autocorrelation function in excellent agreement with that measured directly in the SDSS. The implied Tully-Fisher relation also appears consistent with observation, suggesting that galaxy luminosity functions and Tully-Fisher relations can be reproduced simultaneously in a LCDM cosmology.},

abstract = {Numerical simulations of the intergalactic medium have shown that at the present epoch a significant fraction (40-50\%) of the baryonic component should be found in the (T\~{}10\^{}6K) Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM) - with several recent observational lines of evidence indicating the validity of the prediction. We here recompute the evolution of the WHIM with the following major improvements: (1) galactic superwind feedback processes from galaxy/star formation are explicitly included; (2) major metal species (O V to O IX) are computed explicitly in a non-equilibrium way; (3) mass and spatial dynamic ranges are larger by a factor of 8 and 2, respectively, than in our previous simulations. Here are the major findings: (1) galactic superwinds have dramatic effects, increasing the WHIM mass fraction by about 20\%, primarily through heating up warm gas near galaxies with density 10\^{}\{1.5\}-10\^{}4 times the mean density. (2) the fraction of baryons in WHIM is increased modestly from the earlier work but is \~{}40-50\%. (3) the gas density of the WHIM is broadly peaked at a density 10-20 times the mean density, ranging from underdense regions to regions that are overdense by 10\^{}3-10\^{}4. (4) the median metallicity of the WHIM is 0.18 Zsun for oxygen with 50\% and 90\% intervals being (0.040,0.38) and (0.0017,0.83).},

abstract = {We present a measurement of the correlation function between luminous red galaxies and cool gas traced by Mg II $\backslash$lambda $\backslash$lambda 2796, 2803 absorption, on scales ranging from about 30 kpc to 20 Mpc. The measurement is based on cross-correlating the positions of about one million red galaxies at z\~{}0.5 and the flux decrements induced in the spectra of about 10\^{}5 background quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that: (i) This galaxy-gas correlation reveals a change of slope on scales of about 1 Mpc, consistent with the expected transition from a dark matter halo dominated environment to a regime where clustering is dominated by halo-halo correlations. Assuming that, on average, the distribution of Mg II gas follows that of dark matter up to a gas-to-mass ratio, we find the standard halo model to provide an accurate description of the gas distribution over three orders of magnitude in scale. Within this framework we estimate the average host halo mass of luminous red galaxies to be about 10\^{}\{13.5\} M\_solar, in agreement with other methods. We also find the Mg II gas-to-mass ratio around LRGs to be consistent with the cosmic value estimated on Mpc scales. Combining our galaxy-gas correlation and the galaxy-mass correlation function from galaxy-galaxy lensing analyses we can directly measure the Mg II gas-to-mass ratio as a function of scale and reach the same conclusion. (ii) From line-width estimates, we show that the velocity dispersion of the gas clouds also shows the expected 1- and 2-halo behaviors. On large scales the gas distribution follows the Hubble flow, whereas on small scales we observe the velocity dispersion of the Mg II gas clouds to be lower than that of collisionless dark matter particles within their host halo. This is in line with the fact that cool clouds are subject to the pressure of the virialized hot gas.},

abstract = {Measurements of the total amount of stars locked up in galaxies as a function of host halo mass contain key clues about the efficiency of processes that regulate star formation. We derive the total stellar mass fraction f\_star as a function of halo mass M500c from z=0.2 to z=1 using two complementary methods. First, we derive f\_star using a statistical Halo Occupation Distribution model jointly constrained by data from lensing, clustering, and the stellar mass function. This method enables us to probe f\_star over a much wider halo mass range than with group or cluster catalogs. Second, we derive f\_star at group scales using a COSMOS X-ray group catalog and we show that the two methods agree to within 30\%. We quantify the systematic uncertainty on f\_star using abundance matching methods and we show that the statistical uncertainty on f\_star (\~{}10\%) is dwarfed by systematic uncertainties associated with stellar mass measurements (\~{}45\% excluding IMF uncertainties). Assuming a Chabrier IMF, we find 0.012<f\_star<0.025 at M500c=10\^{}13 Msun and 0.0057<f\_star<0.015 at M500c=10\^{}14 Msun. These values are significantly lower than previously published estimates. We investigate the cause of this difference and find that previous work has overestimated f\_star due to a combination of inaccurate stellar mass estimators and/or because they have assumed that all galaxies in groups are early type galaxies with a constant mass-to-light ratio. Contrary to previous claims, our results suggest that the mean value of f\_star is always significantly lower than f\_gas for halos above 10\^{}13 Msun. Combining our results with recently published gas mas fractions, we find a shortfall in f\_star+f\_gas at R500c compared to the cosmic mean. This shortfall varies with halo mass and becomes larger towards lower halos masses.},

@article{Vanderlinde2010,
abstract = {We present a detection-significance-limited catalog of 21 Sunyaev-Zel'dovich selected galaxy clusters. These clusters, along with 1 unconfirmed candidate, were identified in 178 deg 2 of sky surveyed in 2008 by the South Pole Telescope to a depth of 18 uK-arcmin at 150 GHz. Optical imaging from the Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS) and Magellan telescopes provided photometric (and in some cases spectroscopic) redshift estimates, with catalog redshifts ranging from z=0.15 to z>1, with a median z = 0.74. Of the 21 confirmed galaxy clusters, three were previously identified as Abell clusters, three were presented as SPT discoveries in Staniszewski et al, 2009, and three were first identified in a recent analysis of BCS data by Menanteau et al, 2010; the remaining 12 clusters are presented for the first time in this work. Simulated observations of the SPT fields predict the sample to be nearly 100\% complete above a mass threshold of M200 \~{} 5x10 14 Msun/h at z = 0.6. This completeness threshold pushes to lower mass with increasing redshift, dropping to \~{}4x10 14 Msun/h at z=1. The size and redshift distribution of this catalog are in good agreement with expectations based on our current understanding of galaxy clusters and cosmology. In combination with other cosmological probes, we use the cluster catalog to improve estimates of cosmological parameters. Assuming a standard spatially flat wCDM cosmological model, the addition of our catalog to the WMAP 7-year analysis yields sigma8 = 0.81 0.09 and w = -1.07 0.29, a \~{}50\% improvement in precision on both parameters over WMAP7 alone.},

abstract = {We report the detection of CO(1-0) line emission in the bright, lensed star-forming galaxies SPT-S 233227-5358.5 (z=2.73) and SPT-S 053816-5030.8 (z=2.78), using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). Both galaxies were discovered in a large-area millimeter survey with the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and found to be gravitationally lensed by intervening structures. The measured CO intensities imply galaxies with molecular gas masses of (3.2 $\backslash$pm 0.5)x10\^{}10 (mu/15)\^{}\{-1\}(X\_CO/0.8) M\_sun and (1.7 $\backslash$pm 0.3)x10\^{}10 (mu/20)\^{}\{-1\}(X\_CO/0.8) M\_sun, and gas depletion timescales of 4.9x10\^{}7 (X\_CO/0.8) yr and 2.6x10\^{}7 (X\_CO/0.8) yr, respectively, where mu corresponds to the lens magnification and X\_CO is the CO luminosity to gas mass conversion factor. In the case of SPT-S 053816-5030.8, we also obtained significant detections of the rest-frame 115.7 and 132.4 GHz radio continuum. Based on the radio to infrared spectral energy distribution and an assumed synchrotron spectral index, we find that 42 $\backslash$pm 10 \% and 55 $\backslash$pm 13 \% of the flux at rest-frame 115.7 and 132.4 GHz arise from free-free emission. We find a radio-derived intrinsic star formation rate (SFR) of 470 $\backslash$pm 170 M\_sun/yr, consistent within the uncertainties with the infrared estimate. Based on the morphology of this object in the source plane, the derived gas mass and the possible flattening of the radio spectral index towards low frequencies, we argue that SPT-S 053816-5030.8 exhibits properties compatible with a scaled-up local ultra-luminous infrared galaxy.},

abstract = {How is mass distributed in the universe? How does it compare with the distribution of light and stars? We address these questions by examining the distribution of mass, determined from weak lensing observations, and starlight, around > 10\^{}5 SDSS MaxBCG groups and clusters as a function of environment and scale, from deep inside clusters to large cosmic scales of 22 h\^{}-1 Mpc (Sheldon et al. 2009a). The observed cumulative mass-to-light profile, M/L (< r), rises on small scales, reflecting the increasing M/L of the central bright galaxy of the cluster, then flattens to a nearly constant ratio on scales above \~{} 300 h\^{}-1 kpc, where light follows mass on all scales and in all environments. A trend of slightly decreasing M/L (r) with scale is shown to be consistent with the varying stellar population following the morphology-density relation. This suggests that stars trace mass remarkably well even though they represent only a few percent of the total mass. We determine the stellar mass fraction and find it to be nearly constant on all scales above \~{} 300 h\^{}-1 kpc, with M\_*/M\_tot = 1.0 +/- 0.4\%. We further suggest that most of the dark matter in the universe is located in the large halos of individual galaxies (\~{} 300 kpc for L* galaxies) and show that the entire M/L (r) profile -- from groups and clusters to large-scale structure -- can be accounted for by the aggregate masses of the individual galaxies, plus gas. We use the observed mass-to-light ratio on large scales to determine the mass density of the universe: Omega\_m = 0.24 +/- 0.02 x b\^{}2\_M/L = 0.26 +/- 0.02.},

abstract = {We present the measured Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) flux from 474 optically-selected MaxBCG clusters that fall within the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Equatorial survey region. The ACT Equatorial region used in this analysis covers 510 square degrees and overlaps Stripe 82 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We also present the measured SZ flux stacked on 52 X-ray-selected MCXC clusters that fall within the ACT Equatorial region and an ACT Southern survey region covering 455 square degrees. We find that the measured SZ flux from the X-ray-selected clusters is consistent with expectations. However, we find that the measured SZ flux from the optically-selected clusters is both significantly lower than expectations and lower than the recovered SZ flux measured by the Planck satellite. Since we find a lower recovered SZ signal than Planck, we investigate the possibility that there is a significant offset between the optically-selected brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and the SZ centers, to which ACT is more sensitive due to its finer resolution. Such offsets can arise due to either an intrinsic physical separation between the BCG and the center of the gas concentration or from misidentification of the cluster BCG. We find that the entire discrepancy for both ACT and Planck can be explained by assuming that the BCGs are offset from the SZ maxima with a uniform random distribution between 0 and 1.5 Mpc. Such large offsets between gas peaks and BCGs for optically-selected cluster samples seem unlikely given that we find the physical separation between BCGs and X-ray peaks for an X-ray-selected subsample of MaxBCG clusters to have a much narrower distribution that peaks within 0.2 Mpc. It is possible that other effects are lowering the ACT and Planck signals by the same amount, with offsets between BCGs and SZ peaks explaining the remaining difference between measurements.

abstract = {In the cores of some galaxy clusters the hot intracluster plasma is dense enough that it should cool radiatively in the cluster's lifetime, leading to continuous "cooling flows" of gas sinking towards the cluster center, yet no such cooling flow has been observed. The low observed star formation rates and cool gas masses for these "cool core" clusters suggest that much of the cooling must be offset by astrophysical feedback to prevent the formation of a runaway cooling flow. Here we report X-ray, optical, and infrared observations of the galaxy cluster SPT-CLJ2344-4243 at z = 0.596. These observations reveal an exceptionally luminous (L\_2-10 keV = 8.2 x 10\^{}45 erg/s) galaxy cluster which hosts an extremely strong cooling flow (dM/dt = 3820 +/- 530 Msun/yr). Further, the central galaxy in this cluster appears to be experiencing a massive starburst (740 +/- 160 Msun/yr), which suggests that the feedback source responsible for preventing runaway cooling in nearby cool core clusters may not yet be fully established in SPT-CLJ2344-4243. This large star formation rate implies that a significant fraction of the stars in the central galaxy of this cluster may form via accretion of the intracluster medium, rather than the current picture of central galaxies assembling entirely via mergers.},

@article{Andersson2011,
abstract = {We present results of X-ray observations of a sample of 15 clusters selected via their imprint on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. These clusters are a subset of the first SZ-selected cluster catalog, obtained from observations of 178 deg\^{}2 of sky surveyed by the South Pole Telescope. Using X-ray observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton, we estimate the temperature, T\_X, and mass, M\_g, of the intracluster medium (ICM) within r\_500 for each cluster. From these, we calculate Y\_X=M\_g T\_X and estimate the total cluster mass using a M\_500-Y\_X scaling relation measured from previous X-ray studies. The integrated Comptonization, Y\_SZ, is derived from the SZ measurements, using additional information from the X-ray measured gas density profiles and a universal temperature profile. We calculate scaling relations between the X-ray and SZ observables, and find results generally consistent with other measurements and the expectations from simple self-similar behavior. Specifically, we fit a Y\_SZ-Y\_X relation and find a normalization of 0.82 +- 0.07, marginally consistent with the predicted ratio of Y\_SZ/Y\_X=0.91+-0.01 that would be expected from the density and temperature models used in this work. Using the Y\_X derived mass estimates, we fit a Y\_SZ-M\_500 relation and find a slope consistent with the self-similar expectation of Y\_SZ \~{} M\^{}5/3 with a normalization consistent with predictions from other X-ray studies. We compare the X-ray mass estimates to previously published SZ mass estimates derived from cosmological simulations of the SPT survey. We find that the SZ mass estimates are lower by a factor of 0.89+-0.06, which is within the \~{}15\% systematic uncertainty quoted for the simulation-based SZ masses.},

abstract = {We report new observations of circumgalactic gas in the halos of early-type galaxies (ETGs) obtained by the COS-Halos Survey with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. We find that detections of H I surrounding ETGs are typically as common and strong as around star-forming galaxies, implying that the total mass of circumgalactic material is comparable in the two populations. For ETGs, the covering fraction for H I absorption above 1016 cm-2 is \~{}40\%-50\% within \~{}150 kpc. Line widths and kinematics of the detected material show it to be cold (T <\~{} 105 K) in comparison to the virial temperature of the host halos. The implied masses of cool, photoionized circumgalactic medium baryons may be up to 109-1011 M ⊙. Contrary to some theoretical expectations, strong halo H I absorbers do not disappear as part of the quenching of star formation. Even passive galaxies retain significant reservoirs of halo baryons that could replenish the interstellar gas reservoir and eventually form stars. This halo gas may feed the diffuse and molecular gas that is frequently observed inside ETGs. Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with program GO11598.},

abstract = {We present cosmological parameter constraints based on the final nine-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data, in conjunction with a number of additional cosmological data sets. The WMAP data alone, and in combination, continue to be remarkably well fit by a six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model. When WMAP data are combined with measurements of the high-l cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the baryon acoustic oscillation scale, and the Hubble constant, the matter and energy densities, $\Omega$ b h 2, $\Omega$ c h 2, and $\Omega$$\Lambda$, are each determined to a precision of \~{}1.5\%. The amplitude of the primordial spectrum is measured to within 3\%, and there is now evidence for a tilt in the primordial spectrum at the 5$\sigma$ level, confirming the first detection of tilt based on the five-year WMAP data. At the end of the WMAP mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of the six-dimensional $\Lambda$CDM parameter space by a factor of 68,000 relative to pre-WMAP measurements. We investigate a number of data combinations and show that their $\Lambda$CDM parameter fits are consistent. New limits on deviations from the six-parameter model are presented, for example: the fractional contribution of tensor modes is limited to r < 0.13 (95\% CL); the spatial curvature parameter is limited to $\backslash$Omega \_k = -0.0027\^{}\{+ 0.0039\}\_\{- 0.0038\}; the summed mass of neutrinos is limited to ∑m $\nu$ < 0.44 eV (95\% CL); and the number of relativistic species is found to lie within N eff = 3.84 ± 0.40, when the full data are analyzed. The joint constraint on N eff and the primordial helium abundance, Y He, agrees with the prediction of standard big bang nucleosynthesis. We compare recent Planck measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our seven-year measurements, and show their mutual agreement. Our analysis of the polarization pattern around temperature extrema is updated. This confirms a fundamental prediction of the standard cosmological model and provides a striking illustration of acoustic oscillations and adiabatic initial conditions in the early universe.},

abstract = {We present measurements of the excess mass-to-light ratio measured aroundMaxBCG galaxy clusters observed in the SDSS. This red sequence cluster sample includes objects from small groups with masses ranging from \~{}5x10\^{}\{12\} to \~{}10\^{}\{15\} M\_\{sun\}/h. Using cross-correlation weak lensing, we measure the excess mass density profile above the universal mean $\backslash$Delta $\backslash$rho(r) = $\backslash$rho(r) - $\backslash$bar\{$\backslash$rho\} for clusters in bins of richness and optical luminosity. We also measure the excess luminosity density $\backslash$Delta l(r) = l(r) - $\backslash$bar\{l\} measured in the z=0.25 i-band. For both mass and light, we de-project the profiles to produce 3D mass and light profiles over scales from 25 kpc/ to 22 Mpc/h. From these profiles we calculate the cumulative excess mass M(r) and excess light L(r) as a function of separation from the BCG. On small scales, where $\backslash$rho(r) >> $\backslash$bar\{$\backslash$rho\}, the integrated mass-to-light profile may be interpreted as the cluster mass-to-light ratio. We find the M/L\_\{200\}, the mass-to-light ratio within r\_\{200\}, scales with cluster mass as a power law with index 0.33+/-0.02. On large scales, where $\backslash$rho(r) \~{} $\backslash$bar\{$\backslash$rho\}, the M/L approaches an asymptotic value independent of cluster richness. For small groups, the mean M/L\_\{200\} is much smaller than the asymptotic value, while for large clusters it is consistent with the asymptotic value. This asymptotic value should be proportional to the mean mass-to-light ratio of the universe <M/L>. We find <M/L>/b\^{}2\_\{ml\} = 362+/-54 h (statistical). There is additional uncertainty in the overall calibration at the \~{}10\% level. The parameter b\_\{ml\} is primarily a function of the bias of the L <\~{} L\_* galaxies used as light tracers, and should be of order unity. Multiplying by the luminosity density in the same bandpass we find $\backslash$Omega\_m/b\^{}2\_\{ml\} = 0.02+/-0.03, independent of the Hubble parameter.},

abstract = {We report the first investigation of cool-core properties of galaxy clusters selected via their Sunyaev--Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. We use 13 galaxy clusters uniformly selected from 178 deg\^{}2 observed with the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and followed up by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. They form an approximately mass-limited sample (> 3 x 10\^{}14 M\_sun h\^{}-1\_70) spanning redshifts 0.3 < z < 1.1. Using previously published X-ray-selected cluster samples, we compare two proxies of cool-core strength: surface brightness concentration (cSB) and cuspiness (\{$\backslash$alpha\}). We find that cSB is better constrained. We measure cSB for the SPT sample and find several new z > 0.5 cool-core clusters, including two strong cool cores. This rules out the hypothesis that there are no z > 0.5 clusters that qualify as strong cool cores at the 5.4\{$\backslash$sigma\} level. The fraction of strong cool-core clusters in the SPT sample in this redshift regime is between 7\% and 56\% (95\% confidence). Although the SPT selection function is significantly different from the X-ray samples, the high-z cSB distribution for the SPT sample is statistically consistent with that of X-ray-selected samples at both low and high redshifts. The cool-core strength is inversely correlated with the offset between the brightest cluster galaxy and the X-ray centroid, providing evidence that the dynamical state affects the cool-core strength of the cluster. Larger SZ-selected samples will be crucial in understanding the evolution of cluster cool cores over cosmic time.},

abstract = {We present first results on the cooling properties derived from Chandra X-ray observations of 83 high-redshift (0.3 < z < 1.2) massive galaxy clusters selected by their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signature in the South Pole Telescope data. We measure each cluster's central cooling time, central entropy, and mass deposition rate, and compare to local cluster samples. We find no significant evolution from z\~{}0 to z\~{}1 in the distribution of these properties, suggesting that cooling in cluster cores is stable over long periods of time. We also find that the average cool core entropy profile in the inner \~{}100 kpc has not changed dramatically since z \~{} 1, implying that feedback must be providing nearly constant energy injection to maintain the observed "entropy floor" at \~{}10 keV cm\^{}2. While the cooling properties appear roughly constant over long periods of time, we observe strong evolution in the gas density profile, with the normalized central density (rho\_0/rho\_crit) increasing by an order of magnitude from z \~{} 1 to z \~{} 0. When using metrics defined by the inner surface brightness profile of clusters, we find an apparent lack of classical, cuspy, cool-core clusters at z > 0.75, consistent with earlier reports for clusters at z > 0.5 using similar definitions. Our measurements indicate that cool cores have been steadily growing over the 8 Gyr spanned by our sample, consistent with a constant, \~{}150 Msun/yr cooling flow that is unable to cool below entropies of 10 keV cm\^{}2 and, instead, accumulates in the cluster center. We estimate that cool cores began to assemble in these massive systems at z \~{} 1, which represents the first constraints on the onset of cooling in galaxy cluster cores. We investigate several potential biases which could conspire to mimic this cool core evolution and are unable to find a bias that has a similar redshift dependence and a substantial amplitude.},
