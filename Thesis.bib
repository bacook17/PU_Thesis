abstract = {We report results from the BICEP2 experiment, a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarimeter specifically designed to search for the signal of inflationary gravitational waves in the B-mode power spectrum around l=80. The telescope comprised a 26 cm aperture all-cold refracting optical system equipped with a focal plane of 512 antenna coupled transition edge sensor (TES) 150 GHz bolometers each with temperature sensitivity of approx. 300 uk.sqrt(s). BICEP2 observed from the South Pole for three seasons from 2010 to 2012. A low-foreground region of sky with an effective area of 380 square degrees was observed to a depth of 87 nK-degrees in Stokes Q and U. In this paper we describe the observations, data reduction, maps, simulations and results. We find an excess of B-mode power over the base lensed-LCDM expectation in the range 30<l<150, inconsistent with the null hypothesis at a significance of \$>5\backslash sigma\$. Through jackknife tests and simulations based on detailed calibration measurements we show that systematic contamination is much smaller than the observed excess. We also estimate potential foreground signals and find that available models predict these to be considerably smaller than the observed signal. These foreground models possess no significant cross-correlation with our maps. Additionally, cross-correlating BICEP2 against 100 GHz maps from the BICEP1 experiment, the excess signal is confirmed with \$3\backslash sigma\$ significance and its spectral index is found to be consistent with that of the CMB, disfavoring synchrotron or dust at \$2.3\backslash sigma\$ and \$2.2\backslash sigma\$, respectively. The observed B-mode power spectrum is well-fit by a lensed-LCDM + tensor theoretical model with tensor/scalar ratio \$r=0.20\^{}\{+0.07\}\_\{-0.05\}\$, with r=0 disfavored at \$7.0\backslash sigma\$. Subtracting the best available estimate for foreground dust modifies the likelihood slightly so that r=0 is disfavored at \$5.9\backslash sigma\$.},

abstract = {We present the equivalent width and column density measurements for low and intermediate ionization states of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding 44 low-z, L ≈ L* galaxies drawn from the COS-Halos survey. These measurements are derived from far-UV transitions observed in HST/COS and Keck/HIRES spectra of background quasars within an impact parameter R < 160 kpc to the targeted galaxies. The data show significant metal-line absorption for 33 of the 44 galaxies, including quiescent systems, revealing the common occurrence of a cool (T ≈ 104-105 K), metal-enriched CGM. The detection rates and column densities derived for these metal lines decrease with increasing impact parameter, a trend we interpret as a declining metal surface density profile for the CGM. A comparison of the relative column densities of adjacent ionization states indicates that the gas is predominantly ionized. The large surface density in metals demands a large reservoir of metals and gas in the cool CGM (very conservatively, M cool CGM > 109 M ⊙), which likely traces a distinct density and/or temperature regime from the highly ionized CGM traced by O+5 absorption. The large dispersion in absorption strengths (including non-detections) suggests that the cool CGM traces a wide range of densities or a mix of local ionizing conditions. Lastly, the kinematics inferred from the metal-line profiles are consistent with the cool CGM being bound to the dark matter halos hosting the galaxies; this gas may serve as fuel for future star formation. Future work will leverage this data set to provide estimates on the mass, metallicity, dynamics, and origin of the cool CGM in low-z, L* galaxies.},

abstract = {In the cores of some galaxy clusters the hot intracluster plasma is dense enough that it should cool radiatively in the cluster's lifetime, leading to continuous "cooling flows" of gas sinking towards the cluster center, yet no such cooling flow has been observed. The low observed star formation rates and cool gas masses for these "cool core" clusters suggest that much of the cooling must be offset by astrophysical feedback to prevent the formation of a runaway cooling flow. Here we report X-ray, optical, and infrared observations of the galaxy cluster SPT-CLJ2344-4243 at z = 0.596. These observations reveal an exceptionally luminous (L\_2-10 keV = 8.2 x 10\^{}45 erg/s) galaxy cluster which hosts an extremely strong cooling flow (dM/dt = 3820 +/- 530 Msun/yr). Further, the central galaxy in this cluster appears to be experiencing a massive starburst (740 +/- 160 Msun/yr), which suggests that the feedback source responsible for preventing runaway cooling in nearby cool core clusters may not yet be fully established in SPT-CLJ2344-4243. This large star formation rate implies that a significant fraction of the stars in the central galaxy of this cluster may form via accretion of the intracluster medium, rather than the current picture of central galaxies assembling entirely via mergers.},

abstract = {Scaling properties of galaxy cluster observables with mass provide central insights into the processes shaping clusters. Calibrating proxies for cluster mass will be crucial to cluster cosmology with upcoming surveys like eROSITA and Euclid. The recent Planck results led to suggestions that X-ray masses might be biased low by \$\backslash sim\backslash!40\$ \%, more than previously considered. We extend the direct calibration of the weak lensing -- X-ray mass scaling towards lower masses (as low as \$1\backslash!\backslash times\backslash!10\^{}\{14\}\backslash,\backslash mathrm\{M\}\_\{\backslash odot\}\$) in a sample representative of the \$z\backslash!\backslash sim\backslash!0.4\$--\$0.5\$ population. We investigate the scaling of MMT/Megacam weak lensing (WL) masses for \$8\$ clusters at \$0.39\backslash!\backslash leq\backslash!z\backslash!\backslash leq\backslash!0.80\$ as part of the $\backslash$emph\{400d\} WL programme with hydrostatic $\backslash$textit\{Chandra\} X-ray masses as well as those based on the proxies, e.g. \$Y\_\{\backslash mathrm\{X\}\}\backslash!=\backslash!T\_\{\backslash mathrm\{X\}\}M\_\{\backslash mathrm\{gas\}\}\$. Overall, we find good agreement between WL and X-ray masses, with different mass bias estimators all consistent with zero. Subdividing the sample, we find the high-mass subsample to show no significant mass bias while for the low-mass subsample, there is a bias towards overestimated X-ray masses at the \$\backslash sim\backslash!2\backslash sigma\$ level for some mass proxies. The overall scatter in the mass-mass scaling relations is surprisingly low. Neither observation can be traced back to the parameter settings in the WL analysis. We do not find evidence for a strong (\$\backslash sim\backslash!40\$ \%) underestimate in the X-ray masses, as suggested to reconcile Planck cluster counts and cosmological constraints. For high-mass clusters, our measurements are consistent with studies in the literature. The mass dependent bias, significant at \$\backslash sim\backslash!2\backslash sigma\$, may hint at a physically different cluster population (less relaxed clusters with more substructure and mergers); or it may be due to small number statistics.},

abstract = {We present measurements of the excess mass-to-light ratio measured aroundMaxBCG galaxy clusters observed in the SDSS. This red sequence cluster sample includes objects from small groups with masses ranging from \~{}5x10\^{}\{12\} to \~{}10\^{}\{15\} M\_\{sun\}/h. Using cross-correlation weak lensing, we measure the excess mass density profile above the universal mean $\backslash$Delta $\backslash$rho(r) = $\backslash$rho(r) - $\backslash$bar\{$\backslash$rho\} for clusters in bins of richness and optical luminosity. We also measure the excess luminosity density $\backslash$Delta l(r) = l(r) - $\backslash$bar\{l\} measured in the z=0.25 i-band. For both mass and light, we de-project the profiles to produce 3D mass and light profiles over scales from 25 kpc/ to 22 Mpc/h. From these profiles we calculate the cumulative excess mass M(r) and excess light L(r) as a function of separation from the BCG. On small scales, where $\backslash$rho(r) >> $\backslash$bar\{$\backslash$rho\}, the integrated mass-to-light profile may be interpreted as the cluster mass-to-light ratio. We find the M/L\_\{200\}, the mass-to-light ratio within r\_\{200\}, scales with cluster mass as a power law with index 0.33+/-0.02. On large scales, where $\backslash$rho(r) \~{} $\backslash$bar\{$\backslash$rho\}, the M/L approaches an asymptotic value independent of cluster richness. For small groups, the mean M/L\_\{200\} is much smaller than the asymptotic value, while for large clusters it is consistent with the asymptotic value. This asymptotic value should be proportional to the mean mass-to-light ratio of the universe <M/L>. We find <M/L>/b\^{}2\_\{ml\} = 362+/-54 h (statistical). There is additional uncertainty in the overall calibration at the \~{}10\% level. The parameter b\_\{ml\} is primarily a function of the bias of the L <\~{} L\_* galaxies used as light tracers, and should be of order unity. Multiplying by the luminosity density in the same bandpass we find $\backslash$Omega\_m/b\^{}2\_\{ml\} = 0.02+/-0.03, independent of the Hubble parameter.},

These motions are suggested by several alternating and interleaved X-ray bright, low-temperature, low-entropy arcs located along the east-west axis, at radii ranging from \~{}10 kpc to over a Mpc. Thermodynamic features qualitatively similar to these have previously been observed in the centers of cool core clusters, and were successfully modeled as a consequence of the gas sloshing/swirling motions induced by minor mergers.

abstract = {We present a measurement of the correlation function between luminous red galaxies and cool gas traced by Mg II $\backslash$lambda $\backslash$lambda 2796, 2803 absorption, on scales ranging from about 30 kpc to 20 Mpc. The measurement is based on cross-correlating the positions of about one million red galaxies at z\~{}0.5 and the flux decrements induced in the spectra of about 10\^{}5 background quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that: (i) This galaxy-gas correlation reveals a change of slope on scales of about 1 Mpc, consistent with the expected transition from a dark matter halo dominated environment to a regime where clustering is dominated by halo-halo correlations. Assuming that, on average, the distribution of Mg II gas follows that of dark matter up to a gas-to-mass ratio, we find the standard halo model to provide an accurate description of the gas distribution over three orders of magnitude in scale. Within this framework we estimate the average host halo mass of luminous red galaxies to be about 10\^{}\{13.5\} M\_solar, in agreement with other methods. We also find the Mg II gas-to-mass ratio around LRGs to be consistent with the cosmic value estimated on Mpc scales. Combining our galaxy-gas correlation and the galaxy-mass correlation function from galaxy-galaxy lensing analyses we can directly measure the Mg II gas-to-mass ratio as a function of scale and reach the same conclusion. (ii) From line-width estimates, we show that the velocity dispersion of the gas clouds also shows the expected 1- and 2-halo behaviors. On large scales the gas distribution follows the Hubble flow, whereas on small scales we observe the velocity dispersion of the Mg II gas clouds to be lower than that of collisionless dark matter particles within their host halo. This is in line with the fact that cool clouds are subject to the pressure of the virialized hot gas.},

abstract = {We present the X-ray properties of a massive cluster of galaxies (RXCJ2228.6+2036 at \$z=0.421\$) using \{$\backslash$it XMM-Newton\} data. The X-ray mass modeling is based on the temperature and density distributions of the intracluster medium derived using a deprojection method. We found that RXCJ2228.6+2036 is a hot cluster (\$T\_\{500\}=8.92\^{}\{+1.78\}\_\{-1.32\}\$ keV) showing a cooling flow rate of \$12.0\^{}\{+56.0\}\_\{-12.0\}\$ M\$\_\{\backslash odot\}\$yr\$\^{}\{-1\}\$ based on spectral fitting within the cooling flow radius (\$r\_\{cool\}=147\backslash pm10\$ kpc). The total cluster mass is \$M\_\{500\}=(1.19\backslash pm0.35)\backslash times10\^{}\{15\}\$ M\$\_\{\backslash odot\}\$ and the mean gas mass fraction is \$f\_\{gas\}=0.165\backslash pm0.045\$ at \$r\_\{500\}=1.61\backslash pm0.16\$ Mpc. We discussed the PSF-correction effect on the spectral analysis and found that for the annular width we chose the PSF-corrected temperatures are consistent with those without PSF-correction. We observed a remarkable agreement between X-ray and SZ results, which is of prime importance for the future SZ survey. RXCJ2228.6+2036 obeys the empirical scaling relations found in general massive galaxy clusters (e.g. \$S\$--\$T\$, \$M\$--\$T\$, \$L\$--\$T\$ and \$M\$--\$Y\$) after accounting for self-similar evolution.},

abstract = {In light of the tension in cosmological constraints reported by the Planck team between their SZ-selected cluster counts and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropies, we compare the Planck cluster mass estimates with robust, weak-lensing mass measurements from the Weighing the Giants (WtG) project. For the 22 clusters in common between the Planck cosmology sample and WtG, we find an overall mass ratio of \$\backslash left< M\_\{Planck\}/M\_\{\backslash rm WtG\} \backslash right> = 0.688 \backslash pm 0.072\$. Extending the sample to clusters not used in the Planck cosmology analysis yields a consistent value of \$\backslash left< M\_\{Planck\}/M\_\{\backslash rm WtG\} \backslash right> = 0.698 \backslash pm 0.062\$ from 38 clusters in common. Identifying the weak-lensing masses as proxies for the true cluster mass (on average), these ratios are \$\backslash sim 1.6\backslash sigma\$ lower than the default mass bias of 0.8 assumed in the Planck cluster analysis. Adopting the WtG weak-lensing-based mass calibration would substantially reduce the tension found between the Planck cluster count cosmology results and those from CMB temperature anisotropies. We also find modest evidence (at 95 per cent confidence) for a mass dependence of the calibration ratio and discuss its potential origin in light of systematic uncertainties in the temperature calibration of the X-ray measurements used to calibrate the Planck cluster masses. Our results exemplify the critical role that robust absolute mass calibration plays in cluster cosmology, and the invaluable role of accurate weak-lensing mass measurements in this regard.},

abstract = {We present the weak lensing analysis of the Wide-Field Imager SZ Cluster of Galaxy (WISCy) sample, a set of ten clusters of galaxies selected for their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. After developing new and improved methods for background selection and determination of geometric lensing scaling factors from absolute multi-band photometry in cluster fields, we compare the weak lensing result with public X-ray and SZ data. We find consistency with published hydrostatic X-ray masses with no significant bias and an intrinsic scatter sigma\_(int,log10)=0.13\^{}(+0.11)\_(-0.13). We independently calibrate the SPT significance-mass relation and find consistency with previous results at an intrinsic scatter of sigma\_(int,log10)=0.09\^{}(+0.15)\_(-0.09), with indications for a slightly higher normalisation mass and steeper slope. The comparison of weak lensing mass and Planck Compton parameters, whether extracted self-consistently with a mass-observable relation (MOR) or using X-ray prior information on cluster size, shows significant discrepancies. Since the deviations from the MOR strongly correlate with cluster redshift, we hypothesise that they are related to a size or redshift dependent bias in either signal extraction in the Planck SZ catalogues or their previous X-ray based mass calibration, or in measurement related excess intrinsic scatter.},

@article{Burns2010,
abstract = {Recently, Suzaku has produced temperature and entropy profiles, along with profiles of gas density, gas fraction, and mass, for multiple galaxy clusters out to \~{}r\_200 (\~{}= virial radius). In this paper, we compare these novel X-ray observations with results from N-body + hydrodynamic adaptive mesh refinement cosmological simulations using the Enzo code. There is excellent agreement in the temperature, density, and entropy profiles between a sample of 27 mostly substructure-free massive clusters in the simulated volume and the observed clusters. This supports our previous contention that clusters have "universal" outer temperature profiles. Furthermore, it appears that the simplest adiabatic gas physics used in these Enzo simulations is adequate to model the outer regions of these clusters without other mechanisms (e.g., non-gravitational heating, cooling, magnetic fields, or cosmic rays). However, the outskirts of these clusters are not in hydrostatic equilibrium. There is significant bulk flow and turbulence in the outer intracluster medium created by accretion from filaments. Thus, the gas is not fully supported by thermal pressure. The implications for mass estimation from X-ray data are discussed.},

abstract = {For any assumed stellar Initial Mass Function, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) gives a precise determination of the stellar mass function of galaxies for 10\^{}8 M\_sun < M\_* < 10\^{}12 M\_sun. Within the concordance LCDM cosmology, the Millennium simulations give a precise halo mass function for all halos within which galaxies can form. Under the plausible hypothesis that the stellar mass of a galaxy is an increasing function of the maximum mass ever attained by its halo, these combine to give halo mass as a function of stellar mass. The result agrees quite well with observational estimates of mean halo mass as a function of stellar mass from stacking analyses of the gravitational lensing signal and the satellite dynamics of SDSS galaxies. For M\_* \~{} 5.5 x 10\^{}10 M\_sun, the stellar mass usually assumed for the Milky Way, the implied halo mass is \~{} 2 x 10\^{}12 M\_sun, consistent with most recent direct estimates and inferences from the MW/M31 Timing Argument. The fraction of the baryons associated with each halo which are present as stars in its central galaxy reaches a maximum of 20\% at masses somewhat below that of the Milky Way, and falls rapidly at both higher and lower masses. These conversion efficiencies are lower than in almost all recent high-resolution simulations of galaxy formation, showing that these are not yet viable models for the formation of typical members of the galaxy population. When inserted in the Millennium-II Simulation, our derived relation between stellar mass and halo mass predicts a stellar mass autocorrelation function in excellent agreement with that measured directly in the SDSS. The implied Tully-Fisher relation also appears consistent with observation, suggesting that galaxy luminosity functions and Tully-Fisher relations can be reproduced simultaneously in a LCDM cosmology.},

abstract = {Studies of the diffuse x-ray-emitting gas in galaxy clusters have provided powerful constraints on cosmological parameters and insights into plasma astrophysics. However, measurements of the faint cluster outskirts have become possible only recently. Using data from the Suzaku x-ray telescope, we determined an accurate, spatially resolved census of the gas, metals, and dark matter out to the edge of the Perseus Cluster. Contrary to previous results, our measurements of the cluster baryon fraction are consistent with the expected universal value at half of the virial radius. The apparent baryon fraction exceeds the cosmic mean at larger radii, suggesting a clumpy distribution of the gas, which is important for understanding the ongoing growth of clusters from the surrounding cosmic web.},

abstract = {We have vastly increased the CIV statistics at intermediate redshift by surveying the thousands of quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data-Release 7. We visually verified over 16,000 CIV systems with 1.46 < z < 4.55---a sample size that renders Poisson error negligible. Detailed Monte Carlo simulations show we are approximately 50\% complete down to rest equivalent widths W\_r \~{} 0.6 $\backslash$AA. We analyzed the sample as a whole and in ten small redshift bins with approximately 1500 doublets each. The equivalent width frequency distributions f(W\_r) were well modeled by an exponential, with little evolution in shape. In contrast with previous studies that modeled the frequency distribution as a single power law, the fitted exponential gives a finite mass density for the CIV ions. The co-moving line density dN\_CIV/dX evolved smoothly with redshift, increasing by a factor of 2.37+/-0.09 from z = 4.55 to 1.96, then plateauing at dN\_CIV/dX \~{} 0.34 for z = 1.96 to 1.46. Comparing our SDSS sample with z < 1 (ultraviolet) and z > 5 (infrared) surveys, we see an approximately 10-fold increase in dN\_CIV/dX over z \~{} 6 --> 0, for W\_r >= 0.6 $\backslash$AA. This suggests a monotonic and significant increase in the enrichment of gas outside galaxies over the 12 Gyr lifetime of the universe.},

abstract = {We present a detection-significance-limited catalog of 21 Sunyaev-Zel'dovich selected galaxy clusters. These clusters, along with 1 unconfirmed candidate, were identified in 178 deg 2 of sky surveyed in 2008 by the South Pole Telescope to a depth of 18 uK-arcmin at 150 GHz. Optical imaging from the Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS) and Magellan telescopes provided photometric (and in some cases spectroscopic) redshift estimates, with catalog redshifts ranging from z=0.15 to z>1, with a median z = 0.74. Of the 21 confirmed galaxy clusters, three were previously identified as Abell clusters, three were presented as SPT discoveries in Staniszewski et al, 2009, and three were first identified in a recent analysis of BCS data by Menanteau et al, 2010; the remaining 12 clusters are presented for the first time in this work. Simulated observations of the SPT fields predict the sample to be nearly 100\% complete above a mass threshold of M200 \~{} 5x10 14 Msun/h at z = 0.6. This completeness threshold pushes to lower mass with increasing redshift, dropping to \~{}4x10 14 Msun/h at z=1. The size and redshift distribution of this catalog are in good agreement with expectations based on our current understanding of galaxy clusters and cosmology. In combination with other cosmological probes, we use the cluster catalog to improve estimates of cosmological parameters. Assuming a standard spatially flat wCDM cosmological model, the addition of our catalog to the WMAP 7-year analysis yields sigma8 = 0.81 0.09 and w = -1.07 0.29, a \~{}50\% improvement in precision on both parameters over WMAP7 alone.},

abstract = {[Abridged] We present a catalog of 68 galaxy clusters, of which 19 are new discoveries, detected via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZ) at 148 GHz in the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) survey of 504 square degrees on the celestial equator. A subsample of 48 clusters within the 270 square degree region overlapping SDSS Stripe 82 is estimated to be 90\% complete for M\_500c > 4.5e14 Msun and 0.15 < z < 0.8. While matched filters are used to detect the clusters, the sample is studied further through a "Profile Based Amplitude Analysis" using a single filter at a fixed $\backslash$theta\_500 = 5.9' angular scale. This new approach takes advantage of the "Universal Pressure Profile" (UPP) to fix the relationship between the cluster characteristic size (R\_500) and the integrated Compton parameter (Y\_500). The UPP scalings are found to be nearly identical to an adiabatic model, while a model incorporating non-thermal pressure better matches dynamical mass measurements and masses from the South Pole Telescope. A high signal to noise ratio subsample of 15 ACT clusters is used to obtain cosmological constraints. We first confirm that constraints from SZ data are limited by uncertainty in the scaling relation parameters rather than sample size or measurement uncertainty. We next add in seven clusters from the ACT Southern survey, including their dynamical mass measurements based on galaxy velocity dispersions. In combination with WMAP7 these data simultaneously constrain the scaling relation and cosmological parameters, yielding $\backslash$sigma\_8 = 0.829 $\backslash$pm 0.024 and $\backslash$Omega\_m = 0.292 $\backslash$pm 0.025. The results include marginalization over a 15\% bias in dynamical mass relative to the true halo mass. In an extension to LCDM that incorporates non-zero neutrino mass density, we combine our data with WMAP7+BAO+Hubble constant measurements to constrain $\backslash$Sigma m\_$\backslash$nu < 0.29 eV (95\% C. L.).},

abstract = {We present results of X-ray observations of a sample of 15 clusters selected via their imprint on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. These clusters are a subset of the first SZ-selected cluster catalog, obtained from observations of 178 deg\^{}2 of sky surveyed by the South Pole Telescope. Using X-ray observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton, we estimate the temperature, T\_X, and mass, M\_g, of the intracluster medium (ICM) within r\_500 for each cluster. From these, we calculate Y\_X=M\_g T\_X and estimate the total cluster mass using a M\_500-Y\_X scaling relation measured from previous X-ray studies. The integrated Comptonization, Y\_SZ, is derived from the SZ measurements, using additional information from the X-ray measured gas density profiles and a universal temperature profile. We calculate scaling relations between the X-ray and SZ observables, and find results generally consistent with other measurements and the expectations from simple self-similar behavior. Specifically, we fit a Y\_SZ-Y\_X relation and find a normalization of 0.82 +- 0.07, marginally consistent with the predicted ratio of Y\_SZ/Y\_X=0.91+-0.01 that would be expected from the density and temperature models used in this work. Using the Y\_X derived mass estimates, we fit a Y\_SZ-M\_500 relation and find a slope consistent with the self-similar expectation of Y\_SZ \~{} M\^{}5/3 with a normalization consistent with predictions from other X-ray studies. We compare the X-ray mass estimates to previously published SZ mass estimates derived from cosmological simulations of the SPT survey. We find that the SZ mass estimates are lower by a factor of 0.89+-0.06, which is within the \~{}15\% systematic uncertainty quoted for the simulation-based SZ masses.},

abstract = {Numerical simulations of the intergalactic medium have shown that at the present epoch a significant fraction (40-50\%) of the baryonic component should be found in the (T\~{}10\^{}6K) Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM) - with several recent observational lines of evidence indicating the validity of the prediction. We here recompute the evolution of the WHIM with the following major improvements: (1) galactic superwind feedback processes from galaxy/star formation are explicitly included; (2) major metal species (O V to O IX) are computed explicitly in a non-equilibrium way; (3) mass and spatial dynamic ranges are larger by a factor of 8 and 2, respectively, than in our previous simulations. Here are the major findings: (1) galactic superwinds have dramatic effects, increasing the WHIM mass fraction by about 20\%, primarily through heating up warm gas near galaxies with density 10\^{}\{1.5\}-10\^{}4 times the mean density. (2) the fraction of baryons in WHIM is increased modestly from the earlier work but is \~{}40-50\%. (3) the gas density of the WHIM is broadly peaked at a density 10-20 times the mean density, ranging from underdense regions to regions that are overdense by 10\^{}3-10\^{}4. (4) the median metallicity of the WHIM is 0.18 Zsun for oxygen with 50\% and 90\% intervals being (0.040,0.38) and (0.0017,0.83).},

abstract = {We analyze the association of galaxies to Lya and OVI absorption, the most commonly detected transitions in the low-z intergalactic medium (IGM), in the fields of 14 quasars with z\_em = 0.06-0.57. Confirming previous studies, we observe a high covering fraction for Lya absorption to impact parameter rho = 300kpc: 33/37 of our L>0.01L* galaxies show Lya equivalent width W\_Lya>50mA. Galaxies of all luminosity L>0.01L* and spectral type are surrounded by a diffuse and ionized circumgalactic medium (CGM), whose baryonic mass is estimated at \~{}10\^{}(10.5 +/- 0.3) Msun for a constant N\_H. The virialized halos and extended CGM of present-day galaxies are responsible for most strong Lya absorbers (W\_Lya > 300mA) but cannot reproduce the majority of observed lines in the Lya forest. We conclude that the majority of Lya absorption with W\_Lya=30-300mA occurs in the cosmic web predicted by cosmological simulations and estimate a characteristic width for these filaments of \~{}400kpc. Regarding OVI, we observe a near unity covering fraction to rho=200kpc for L>0.1L* galaxies and to rho = 300kpc for sub-L* (0.1 L*<L<L*) galaxies. Similar to our Lya results, stronger OVI systems (W\_OVI > 70mA) arise in the virialized halos of L>0.1L* galaxies. Unlike Lya, the weaker OVI systems (W\_OVI\~{}30mA) arise in the extended CGM of sub-L* galaxies. The majority of OVI gas observed in the low-z IGM is associated with a diffuse medium surrounding individual galaxies with L\~{}0.3L*, and rarely originates in the so-called warm-hot IGM (WHIM) predicted by cosmological simulations.},

abstract = {We report the first investigation of cool-core properties of galaxy clusters selected via their Sunyaev--Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. We use 13 galaxy clusters uniformly selected from 178 deg\^{}2 observed with the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and followed up by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. They form an approximately mass-limited sample (> 3 x 10\^{}14 M\_sun h\^{}-1\_70) spanning redshifts 0.3 < z < 1.1. Using previously published X-ray-selected cluster samples, we compare two proxies of cool-core strength: surface brightness concentration (cSB) and cuspiness (\{$\backslash$alpha\}). We find that cSB is better constrained. We measure cSB for the SPT sample and find several new z > 0.5 cool-core clusters, including two strong cool cores. This rules out the hypothesis that there are no z > 0.5 clusters that qualify as strong cool cores at the 5.4\{$\backslash$sigma\} level. The fraction of strong cool-core clusters in the SPT sample in this redshift regime is between 7\% and 56\% (95\% confidence). Although the SPT selection function is significantly different from the X-ray samples, the high-z cSB distribution for the SPT sample is statistically consistent with that of X-ray-selected samples at both low and high redshifts. The cool-core strength is inversely correlated with the offset between the brightest cluster galaxy and the X-ray centroid, providing evidence that the dynamical state affects the cool-core strength of the cluster. Larger SZ-selected samples will be crucial in understanding the evolution of cluster cool cores over cosmic time.},

abstract = {Measurements of X-ray scaling laws are critical for improving cosmological constraints derived with the halo mass function and for understanding the physical processes that govern the heating and cooling of the intracluster medium. In this paper, we use a sample of 206 X-ray selected galaxy groups to investigate the scaling relation between X-ray luminosity (Lx) and halo mass (M00) where M200 is derived via stacked weak gravitational lensing. This work draws upon a broad array of multi-wavelength COSMOS observations including 1.64 square degrees of contiguous imaging with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and deep XMM-Newton/Chandra imaging. The combined depth of these two data-sets allows us to probe the lensing signals of X-ray detected structures at both higher redshifts and lower masses than previously explored. Weak lensing profiles and halo masses are derived for nine sub-samples, narrowly binned in luminosity and redshift. The COSMOS data alone are well fit by a power law, M200 \~{} Lx\^{}a, with a slope of a=0.66+-0.14. These results significantly extend the dynamic range for which the halo masses of X-ray selected structures have been measured with weak gravitational lensing. As a result, tight constraints are obtained for the slope of the M-Lx relation. The combination of our group data with previously published cluster data demonstrates that the M-Lx relation is well described by a single power law, a=0.64+-0.03, over two decades in mass, 10\^{}13.5-10\^{}15.5 h72\^{}-1 Msun. These results are inconsistent at the 3.7 level with the self-similar prediction of a=0.75. We examine the redshift dependence of the M-Lx relation and find little evidence for evolution beyond the rate predicted by self-similarity from z \~{} 0.25 to z \~{} 0.8.},

abstract = {Using a set of hydrodynamical simulations of 9 galaxy clusters with masses in the range 1.5 10\^{}\{14\} M\_sun < M\_vir < 3.4 10\^{}\{15\} M\_sun, we have studied the density, temperature and X-ray surface brightness profiles of the intracluster medium in the regions around the virial radius. We have analyzed the profiles in the radial range well above the cluster core, the physics of which are still unclear and matter of tension between simulated and observed properties, and up to the virial radius and beyond, where present observations are unable to provide any constraints. We have modeled the radial profiles between 0.3 R\_200 and 3 R\_200 with power laws with one index, two indexes and a rolling index. The simulated temperature and [0.5-2] keV surface brightness profiles well reproduce the observed behaviours outside the core. The shape of all these profiles in the radial range considered depends mainly on the activity of the gravitational collapse, with no significant difference among models including extraphysics. The profiles steepen in the outskirts, with the slope of the power-law fit that changes from -2.5 to -3.4 in the gas density, from -0.5 to -1.8 in the gas temperature, and from -3.5 to -5.0 in the X-ray soft surface brightness. We predict that the gas density, temperature and [0.5-2] keV surface brightness values at R\_200 are, on average, 0.05, 0.60, 0.008 times the measured values at 0.3 R\_200. At 2 R\_200, these values decrease by an order of magnitude in the gas density and surface brightness, by a factor of 2 in the temperature, putting stringent limits on the detectable properties of the intracluster-medium (ICM) in the virial regions.},

abstract = {We present the first results based on Planck measurements of the CMB temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. The Planck spectra at high multipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter LCDM cosmology. In this model Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density parameter, Omega\_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an analysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95\% upper limit of r<0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles. Using BAO and CMB data, we find N\_eff=3.30+/-0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the summed neutrino mass. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of N\_eff=3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy. Despite the success of the standard LCDM model, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the CMB power spectrum at low multipoles, as noted previously by the WMAP team. While not of decisive significance, this is an anomaly in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.},

abstract = {We investigate if the discrepancy between estimates of the total baryon mass fraction obtained from observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and of galaxy groups/clusters persists when a large sample of groups is considered. To this purpose, 91 candidate X-ray groups/poor clusters at redshift 0.1 < z < 1 are selected from the COSMOS 2 deg\^{}2 survey, based only on their X-ray luminosity and extent. This sample is complemented by 27 nearby clusters with a robust, analogous determination of the total and stellar mass inside R\_500. The total sample of 118 groups and clusters with z < 1 spans a range in M\_500 of \~{}10\^{}13--10\^{}15 M\_sun. We find that the stellar mass fraction associated with galaxies at R\_500 decreases with increasing total mass as (M\_500)\^{}-0.37 $\backslash$pm 0.04, independent of redshift. Estimating the total gas mass fraction from a recently derived, high quality scaling relation, the total baryon mass fraction (f\_500\^{}stars+gas=f\_500\^{}stars+f\_500\^{}gas) is found to increase by \~{} 25\% when M\_500 increases from <M>=5 X 10\^{}13 M\_sun to <M> = 7 X 10\^{}14 M\_sun. After consideration of a plausible contribution due to intra--cluster light (11--22\% of the total stellar mass), and gas depletion through the hierarchical assembly process (10\% of the gas mass), the estimated values of the total baryon mass fraction are still lower than the latest CMB measure of the same quantity (WMAP5), at a significance level of 3.3$\backslash$sigma for groups of <M>=5 X 10\^{}13\~{}M\_sun. The discrepancy decreases towards higher total masses, such that it is 1$\backslash$sigma at <M>= 7 X 10\^{}14\~{}M\_sun. We discuss this result in terms of non--gravitational processes such as feedback and filamentary heating.},

abstract = {(Abridged) We present results of Suzaku observations of the intracluster medium (ICM) in Abell 1689, combined with complementary analysis of the SDSS data and weak and strong lensing analysis of Subaru/Suprime-Cam and HST/ACS observations. Faint X-ray emission from the ICM around the virial radius is detected at 4.0 sigma significance. We find anisotropic gas temperature and entropy distributions in cluster outskirts correlated with large-scale structure of galaxies. The high temperature and entropy region in the northeastern (NE) outskirts is connected to an overdense filamentary structure. The outskirt regions in contact with low density void environments have low gas temperatures and entropies, deviating from hydrostatic equilibrium. These results suggest that thermalization of the ICM occurs faster along the filamentary structures than the void regions. A joint X-ray and lensing analysis shows that the hydrostatic mass is \$\backslash sim60-90\%\$ of spherical lensing one but comparable to a triaxial halo mass within errors in \$0.6r\_\{2500\} \backslash simlt r \backslash simlt 0.8r\_\{500\}\$, and that it is significantly biased as low as \$\backslash simlt60\%\$ within \$0.4r\_\{2500\}\$, irrespective of mass models. The thermal gas pressure within \$r\_\{500\}\$ is, at most, \$\backslash sim50\$--60\% of the total pressure to balance fully the gravity of the spherical lensing mass, and \$\backslash sim30\$--40\% around the virial radius. Although these constitute lower limits when one considers the possible halo triaxiality, these small relative contributions of thermal pressure would require additional sources of pressure, such as bulk and/or turbulent motions.},

In a survey of the outskirts of 42 galaxies with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope, we detected ubiquitous, large (150-kiloparsec) halos of ionized oxygen surrounding star-forming galaxies; we found much less ionized oxygen around galaxies with little or no star formation. This ionized CGM contains a substantial mass of heavy elements and gas, perhaps far exceeding the reservoirs of gas in the galaxies themselves. Our data indicate that it is a basic component of nearly all star-forming galaxies that is removed or transformed during the quenching of star formation and the transition to passive evolution.},

abstract = {Observations of clusters of galaxies suggest that they contain fewer baryons (gas plus stars) than the cosmic baryon fraction. This "missing baryon" puzzle is especially surprising for the most massive clusters, which are expected to be representative of the cosmic matter content of the universe (baryons and dark matter). Here we show that the baryons may not actually be missing from clusters, but rather are extended to larger radii than typically observed. The baryon deficiency is typically observed in the central regions of clusters (∼0.5 the virial radius). However, the observed gas-density profile is significantly shallower than the mass-density profile, implying that the gas is more extended than the mass and that the gas fraction increases with radius. We use the observed density profiles of gas and mass in clusters to extrapolate the measured baryon fraction as a function of radius and as a function of cluster mass. We find that the baryon fraction reaches the cosmic value near the virial radius for all groups and clusters above ∼5 x 10(13)h(-1)(72)M. This suggests that the baryons are not missing, they are simply located in cluster outskirts. Heating processes (such as shock-heating of the intracluster gas, supernovae, and Active Galactic Nuclei feedback) likely contribute to this expanded distribution. Upcoming observations should be able to detect these baryons.},

abstract = {We present cosmological parameter constraints based on the final nine-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data, in conjunction with a number of additional cosmological data sets. The WMAP data alone, and in combination, continue to be remarkably well fit by a six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model. When WMAP data are combined with measurements of the high-l cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the baryon acoustic oscillation scale, and the Hubble constant, the matter and energy densities, $\Omega$ b h 2, $\Omega$ c h 2, and $\Omega$$\Lambda$, are each determined to a precision of \~{}1.5\%. The amplitude of the primordial spectrum is measured to within 3\%, and there is now evidence for a tilt in the primordial spectrum at the 5$\sigma$ level, confirming the first detection of tilt based on the five-year WMAP data. At the end of the WMAP mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of the six-dimensional $\Lambda$CDM parameter space by a factor of 68,000 relative to pre-WMAP measurements. We investigate a number of data combinations and show that their $\Lambda$CDM parameter fits are consistent. New limits on deviations from the six-parameter model are presented, for example: the fractional contribution of tensor modes is limited to r < 0.13 (95\% CL); the spatial curvature parameter is limited to $\backslash$Omega \_k = -0.0027\^{}\{+ 0.0039\}\_\{- 0.0038\}; the summed mass of neutrinos is limited to ∑m $\nu$ < 0.44 eV (95\% CL); and the number of relativistic species is found to lie within N eff = 3.84 ± 0.40, when the full data are analyzed. The joint constraint on N eff and the primordial helium abundance, Y He, agrees with the prediction of standard big bang nucleosynthesis. We compare recent Planck measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our seven-year measurements, and show their mutual agreement. Our analysis of the polarization pattern around temperature extrema is updated. This confirms a fundamental prediction of the standard cosmological model and provides a striking illustration of acoustic oscillations and adiabatic initial conditions in the early universe.},

abstract = {We present the measured Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) flux from 474 optically-selected MaxBCG clusters that fall within the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Equatorial survey region. The ACT Equatorial region used in this analysis covers 510 square degrees and overlaps Stripe 82 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We also present the measured SZ flux stacked on 52 X-ray-selected MCXC clusters that fall within the ACT Equatorial region and an ACT Southern survey region covering 455 square degrees. We find that the measured SZ flux from the X-ray-selected clusters is consistent with expectations. However, we find that the measured SZ flux from the optically-selected clusters is both significantly lower than expectations and lower than the recovered SZ flux measured by the Planck satellite. Since we find a lower recovered SZ signal than Planck, we investigate the possibility that there is a significant offset between the optically-selected brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and the SZ centers, to which ACT is more sensitive due to its finer resolution. Such offsets can arise due to either an intrinsic physical separation between the BCG and the center of the gas concentration or from misidentification of the cluster BCG. We find that the entire discrepancy for both ACT and Planck can be explained by assuming that the BCGs are offset from the SZ maxima with a uniform random distribution between 0 and 1.5 Mpc. Such large offsets between gas peaks and BCGs for optically-selected cluster samples seem unlikely given that we find the physical separation between BCGs and X-ray peaks for an X-ray-selected subsample of MaxBCG clusters to have a much narrower distribution that peaks within 0.2 Mpc. It is possible that other effects are lowering the ACT and Planck signals by the same amount, with offsets between BCGs and SZ peaks explaining the remaining difference between measurements.

abstract = {How much dark matter is there in the universe and where is it located? These are two of the most fundamental questions in cosmology. We use in this paper optical and x-ray mass determinations of galaxies, groups, and clusters of galaxies to suggest that most of the dark matter may reside in very large halos around galaxies, typically extending to \~{}200 kpc for bright galaxies. We show that the mass-to-light ratio of galaxy systems does not increase significantly with linear scale beyond the very large halos suggested for individual galaxies. Rather, the total mass of large scale systems such as groups and rich clusters of galaxies, even superclusters, can on average be accounted for by the total mass of their member galaxies, including their large halos (which may be stripped-off in the dense cluster environment but still remain in the clusters) plus the mass of the hot intracluster gas. This conclusion also suggests that we may live in a low-density universe with Omega \~{} 0.2 - 0.3.},

@article{Rudie2013,
abstract = {We present new high-precision measurements of the opacity of the intergalactic and circumgalactic medium (IGM, CGM) at <z>=2.4. Using Voigt profile fits to the full Lyman alpha and Lyman beta forests in 15 high-resolution high-S/N spectra of hyperluminous QSOs, we make the first statistically robust measurement of the frequency of absorbers with HI column densities 14 < log(NHI) < 17.2. We also present the first measurements of the frequency distribution of HI absorbers in the volume surrounding high-z galaxies (the CGM, 300 pkpc), finding that the incidence of absorbers in the CGM is much higher than in the IGM. In agreement with Rudie et al. (2012), we find that there are fractionally more high-NHI absorbers than low-NHI absorbers in the CGM compared to the IGM, leading to a shallower power law fit to the CGM frequency distribution. We use these new measurements to calculate the total opacity of the IGM and CGM to hydrogen-ionizing photons, finding significantly higher opacity than most previous studies, especially from absorbers with log(NHI) < 17.2. Reproducing the opacity measured in our data as well as the incidence of absorbers with log(NHI) > 17.2 requires a broken power law parameterization of the frequency distribution with a break near log(NHI) \~{} 15. We compute new estimates of the mean free path (mfp) to hydrogen-ionizing photons at z=2.4, finding mfp = 147 +- 15 Mpc when considering only IGM opacity. If instead, we consider photons emanating from a high-z star-forming galaxy and account for the local excess opacity due to the surrounding CGM of the galaxy itself, the mean free path is reduced to mfp = 121 +- 15 Mpc. These mfp measurements are smaller than recent estimates and should inform future studies of the metagalactic UV background and of ionizing sources at z\~{}2-3.},

abstract = {We present follow-up observations with the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Array (SZA) of optically-confirmed galaxy clusters found in the equatorial survey region of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT): ACT-CL J0022-0036, ACT-CL J2051+0057, and ACT-CL J2337+0016. ACT-CL J0022-0036 is a newly-discovered, massive (10\^{}15 Msun), high-redshift (z=0.81) cluster revealed by ACT through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE). Deep, targeted observations with the SZA allow us to probe a broader range of cluster spatial scales, better disentangle cluster decrements from radio point source emission, and derive more robust integrated SZE flux and mass estimates than we can with ACT data alone. For the two clusters we detect with the SZA we compute integrated SZE signal and derive masses from the SZA data only. ACT-CL J2337+0016, also known as Abell 2631, has archival Chandra data that allow an additional X-ray-based mass estimate. Optical richness is also used to estimate cluster masses and shows good agreement with the SZE and X-ray-based estimates. Based on the point sources detected by the SZA in these three cluster fields and an extrapolation to ACT's frequency, we estimate that point sources could be contaminating the SZE decrement at the <= 20\% level for some fraction of clusters.},

abstract = {Measurements of the total amount of stars locked up in galaxies as a function of host halo mass contain key clues about the efficiency of processes that regulate star formation. We derive the total stellar mass fraction f\_star as a function of halo mass M500c from z=0.2 to z=1 using two complementary methods. First, we derive f\_star using a statistical Halo Occupation Distribution model jointly constrained by data from lensing, clustering, and the stellar mass function. This method enables us to probe f\_star over a much wider halo mass range than with group or cluster catalogs. Second, we derive f\_star at group scales using a COSMOS X-ray group catalog and we show that the two methods agree to within 30\%. We quantify the systematic uncertainty on f\_star using abundance matching methods and we show that the statistical uncertainty on f\_star (\~{}10\%) is dwarfed by systematic uncertainties associated with stellar mass measurements (\~{}45\% excluding IMF uncertainties). Assuming a Chabrier IMF, we find 0.012<f\_star<0.025 at M500c=10\^{}13 Msun and 0.0057<f\_star<0.015 at M500c=10\^{}14 Msun. These values are significantly lower than previously published estimates. We investigate the cause of this difference and find that previous work has overestimated f\_star due to a combination of inaccurate stellar mass estimators and/or because they have assumed that all galaxies in groups are early type galaxies with a constant mass-to-light ratio. Contrary to previous claims, our results suggest that the mean value of f\_star is always significantly lower than f\_gas for halos above 10\^{}13 Msun. Combining our results with recently published gas mas fractions, we find a shortfall in f\_star+f\_gas at R500c compared to the cosmic mean. This shortfall varies with halo mass and becomes larger towards lower halos masses.},

abstract = {(Abridged) This paper presents an absorption-line study of the multiphase circumgalactic medium (CGM) based on observations of a suite of absorption features including Lya, CII, CIV, SiII, SiIII, and SiIV transitions. Cross-matching between public galaxy and QSO survey data has yielded 111 independent galaxy and QSO pairs for which high-quality archival UV spectra of the QSOs and multi-wavelength observations of the galaxies are available. The galaxy sample is characterized by a median redshift of <z> = 0.0232, a median projected distance of <d> = 342 kpc, and a median stellar mass of log (Mstar/Msun) = 9.04$\backslash$pm 0.93. It is therefore dominated by low-mass dwarf galaxies. Comparing the absorber features identified in the QSO spectra with galaxy properties has led to strong constraints for the CGM at z<\~{}0.06. While abundant hydrogen gas is found beyond the dark matter halo radius Rh and all through d\~{}500 kpc with a mean covering fraction of \~{}50\%, no heavy elements are detected at d>\~{}0.5 Rh. The lack of heavy elements at large distances is unlikely due to ionization effects, since it persists through all ionization states included in the study. Considering all galaxies at d>Rh leads to a strict upper limit for the covering fraction of heavy elements of \~{}4\% (at a 95\% confidence level) over d=(1-10) Rh. At d<0.5 Rh, differential covering fraction between low- and high-ionization gas is observed, suggesting that the CGM becomes progressively more ionized from d<0.2 Rh to larger distances. Comparing absorption-line observations of the CGM at low and high redshifts shows that massive starburst galaxies at z=2.2 exhibit significantly stronger mean absorption than dwarf galaxies at z\~{}0 and the distinction is most pronounced in low-ionization species traced by CII and SiII absorption lines, suggesting distinct ionization conditions between the CGM at low and high redshifts.},

abstract = {We present radial entropy profiles of the intracluster medium (ICM) for a collection of 239 clusters taken from the Chandra X-ray Observatory's Data Archive. Entropy is of great interest because it controls ICM global properties and records the thermal history of a cluster. Entropy is therefore a useful quantity for studying the effects of feedback on the cluster environment and investigating any breakdown of cluster self-similarity. We find that most ICM entropy profiles are well fitted by a model which is a power law at large radii and approaches a constant value at small radii: K(r) = K 0 + K 100(r/100 kpc)$\alpha$, where K 0 quantifies the typical excess of core entropy above the best-fitting power law found at larger radii. We also show that the K 0 distributions of both the full archival sample and the primary Highest X-Ray Flux Galaxy Cluster Sample of Reiprich (2001) are bimodal with a distinct gap between K 0 ≈ 30-50 keV cm2 and population peaks at K 0 \~{} 15 keV cm2 and K 0 \~{} 150 keV cm2. The effects of point-spread function smearing and angular resolution on best-fit K 0 values are investigated using mock Chandra observations and degraded entropy profiles, respectively. We find that neither of these effects is sufficient to explain the entropy-profile flattening we measure at small radii. The influence of profile curvature and number of radial bins on best-fit K 0 is also considered, and we find no indication that K 0 is significantly impacted by either. For completeness, we include previously unpublished optical spectroscopy of H$\alpha$ and [N II] emission lines discussed in Cavagnolo et al. (2008a). All data and results associated with this work are publicly available via the project Web site.},

We test this hypothesis with observations of 74 close-projected quasar pairs, using spectra of the background QSO to characterize the CGM of the foreground one. Surprisingly, our measurements reveal a cool (T ≈ 104 K), massive (M CGM > 1010 M ⊙), and metal-enriched (Z >\~{} 0.1 Z ⊙) medium extending to at least the expected virial radius (r vir = 160 kpc). The average equivalent widths of H I Ly$\alpha$ ($\backslash$bar\{W\}\_Ly$\backslash$alpha = 2.1 +/- 0.15 \AA for impact parameters R < 200 kpc) and C II 1334 ($\backslash$bar\{W\}\_\{1334\} = 0.7 +/- 0.1) exceed the corresponding CGM measurements of these transitions from all galaxy populations studied previously. Furthermore, we conservatively estimate that the quasar CGM has a 64+6 -7\% covering fraction of optically thick gas (N H I > 1017.2 cm-2) within r vir; this covering factor is twice that of the contemporaneous Lyman break galaxy population. This unexpected reservoir of cool gas is rarely detected "down-the-barrel" to quasars, and hence it is likely that our background sight lines intercept gas that is shadowed from the quasar ionizing radiation by the same obscuring medium often invoked in models of active galactic nucleus unification. Because the high-z halos inhabited by quasars predate modern groups and clusters, these observations are also relevant to the formation and enrichment history of the intragroup/intracluster medium.},

abstract = {We present results from the analysis of a mosaic of thirteen XMM-Newton pointings covering the Virgo Cluster from its center northwards out to a radius r\~{}1.2 Mpc (\~{}4.5 degrees), reaching the virial radius and beyond. This is the first time that the properties of a modestly sized (M\_vir\~{}1.4e14 M\_sun, kT\~{}2.3 keV), dynamically young cluster have been studied out to the virial radius. The density profile of the cluster can be described by a surprisingly shallow power-law with index 1.21+/-0.12. In the radial range of 0.3r\_vir<r<r\_vir, the best fit temperature drops by roughly 60 per cent. Within a radius r<450 kpc, the entropy profile has an approximate power-law form with index 1.1, as expected for gravitationally collapsed gas in hydrostatic equilibrium. Beyond r\~{}450 kpc, however, the temperature and metallicity drop abruptly, and the entropy profile becomes flatter, staying consistently below the expected value by a factor of 2-2.5. The most likely explanation for the unusually shallow density profile and the flattening of entropy at large radius is clumping in the ICM. Our data provide direct observational evidence that the ICM is enriched by metals all the way to r\_200 to at least Z=0.1 Solar.},

abstract = {Studies of galaxy clusters have proved crucial in helping to establish the standard model of cosmology, with a universe dominated by dark matter and dark energy. A theoretical basis that describes clusters as massive, multi-component, quasi-equilibrium systems is growing in its capability to interpret multi-wavelength observations of expanding scope and sensitivity. We review current cosmological results, including contributions to fundamental physics, obtained from observations of galaxy clusters. These results are consistent with and complementary to those from other methods. We highlight several areas of opportunity for the next few years, and emphasize the need for accurate modeling of survey selection and sources of systematic error. Capitalizing on these opportunities will require a multi-wavelength approach and the application of rigorous statistical frameworks, utilizing the combined strengths of observers, simulators and theorists.},

The SPT‐SZ focal plane consists of over 700 background limited TES spiderweb bolometers observing in three different pass bands (90 GHz, 150 GHz, and 220 GHz) readout by a frequency domain SQUID multiplexer. Together with the 10‐m South Pole Telescope, SPT‐SZ has realized exceptional sensitivity at arcminute resolution over a one degree field of view and is the first instrument to discover new galaxy clusters through the SZ effect. We will discuss the SPT‐SZ design and deployment, present initial results from the first two seasons, and outline future survey plans. © 2009 American Institute of Physics},

abstract = {We present a catalog of 224 galaxy cluster candidates, selected through their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signature in the first 720 deg2 of the South Pole Telescope (SPT) survey. This area was mapped with the SPT in the 2008 and 2009 austral winters to a depth of 18 uK-arcmin at 150 GHz; 550 deg2 of it was also mapped to 44 uK-arcmin at 95 GHz. Based on optical imaging of all candidates and near-infrared imaging of the majority of candidates, we have found optical and/or infrared counterparts for 158 clusters. Of these, 135 were first identified as clusters in SPT data, including 117 new discoveries reported in this work. This catalog triples the number of confirmed galaxy clusters discovered through the SZ effect. We report photometrically derived (and in some cases spectroscopic) redshifts for confirmed clusters and redshift lower limits for the remaining candidates. The catalog extends to high redshift with a median redshift of z = 0.55 and maximum redshift of z = 1.37. Based on simulations, we expect the catalog to be nearly 100\% complete above M500 \~{} 5e14 Msun h\_\{70\}\^{}-1 at z > 0.6. There are 121 candidates detected at signal-to-noise greater than five, at which the catalog purity is measured to be 95\%. From this high-purity subsample, we exclude the z < 0.3 clusters and use the remaining 100 candidates to improve cosmological constraints following the method presented by Benson et al., 2011. Adding the cluster data to CMB+BAO+H0 data leads to a preference for non-zero neutrino masses while only slightly reducing the upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses to sum mnu < 0.38 eV (95\% CL). For a spatially flat wCDM cosmological model, the addition of this catalog to the CMB+BAO+H0+SNe results yields sigma8=0.807+-0.027 and w = -1.010+-0.058, improving the constraints on these parameters by a factor of 1.4 and 1.3, respectively.

abstract = {We introduce the Marenostrum-MultiDark SImulations of galaxy Clusters (MUSIC) Dataset, one of the largest sample of hydrodynamically simulated galaxy clusters with more than 500 clusters and 2000 groups. The objects have been selected from two large N-body simulations and have been resimulated at high resolution using SPH together with relevant physical processes (cooling, UV photoionization, star formation and different feedback processes). We focus on the analysis of the baryon content (gas and star) of clusters in the MUSIC dataset both as a function of aperture radius and redshift. The results from our simulations are compared with the most recent observational estimates of the gas fraction in galaxy clusters at different overdensity radii. When the effects of cooling and stellar feedbacks are included, the MUSIC clusters show a good agreement with the most recent observed gas fractions quoted in the literature. A clear dependence of the gas fractions with the total cluster mass is also evident. The impact of the aperture radius choice, when comparing integrated quantities at different redshifts, is tested: the standard definition of radius at a fixed overdensity with respect to critical density is compared with a definition based on the redshift dependent overdensity with respect to background density. We also present a detailed analysis of the scaling relations of the thermal SZ (Sunyaev Zel'dovich) Effect derived from MUSIC clusters. The integrated SZ brightness, Y, is related to the cluster total mass, M, as well as, the M-Y counterpart, more suitable for observational applications. Both laws are consistent with predictions from the self-similar model, showing a very low scatter. The effects of the gas fraction on the Y-M scaling and the presence of a possible redshift dependence on the Y-M scaling relation are also explored.},

abstract = {We present the work of an international team at the International Space Science Institute (ISSI) in Bern that worked together to review the current observational and theoretical status of the non-virialised X-ray emission components in clusters of galaxies. The subject is important for the study of large-scale hierarchical structure formation and to shed light on the "missing baryon" problem. The topics of the team work include thermal emission and absorption from the warm-hot intergalactic medium, non-thermal X-ray emission in clusters of galaxies, physical processes and chemical enrichment of this medium and clusters of galaxies, and the relationship between all these processes. One of the main goals of the team is to write and discuss a series of review papers on this subject. These reviews are intended as introductory text and reference for scientists wishing to work actively in this field. The team consists of sixteen experts in observations, theory and numerical simulations.},

abstract = {We present the optical and X-ray properties of 68 galaxy clusters selected via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect at 148 GHz by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Our sample, from an area of 504 square degrees centered on the celestial equator, is divided into two regions. The main region uses 270 square degrees of the ACT survey that overlaps with the co-added ugriz imaging from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) over Stripe 82 plus additional near-infrared pointed observations with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5-meter telescope. We confirm a total of 49 clusters to z\~{}1.3, of which 22 (all at z>0.55) are new discoveries. For the second region the regular-depth SDSS imaging allows us to confirm 19 more clusters up to z\~{}0.7, of which 10 systems are new. We present the optical richness, photometric redshifts, and separation between the SZ position and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We find no significant offset between the cluster SZ centroid and BCG location and a weak correlation between optical richness and SZ-derived mass. We also present X-ray fluxes and luminosities from the ROSAT All Sky Survey which confirm that this is a massive sample. One of the newly discovered clusters, ACT-CL J0044.4+0113 at z=1.1 (photometric), has an integrated XMM-Newton X-ray temperature of kT\_x=7.9+/-1.0 keV and combined mass of M\_200a=8.2(-2.5,+3.3)x10\^{}14 M\_sun/h70 placing it among the most massive and X-ray-hot clusters known at redshifts beyond z=1. We also highlight the optically-rich cluster ACT-CL J2327.4-0204 (RCS2 2327) at z=0.705 (spectroscopic) as the most significant detection of the whole equatorial sample with a Chandra-derived mass of M\_200a=1.9(-0.4,+0.6)x10\^{}15 M\_sun/h70, comparable to some of the most massive known clusters like "El Gordo" and the Bullet Cluster.},

@article{Borthakur2013,
abstract = {We present a study exploring the impact of a starburst on the properties of the surrounding circum-galactic medium (CGM): gas located beyond the galaxy's stellar body and extending out to the virial radius (200 kpc). We obtained ultraviolet spectroscopic data from the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS) probing the CGM of 20 low-redshift foreground galaxies using background QSOs. Our sample consists of starburst and control galaxies. The latter comprises normal star-forming and passive galaxies with similar stellar masses and impact parameters as the starbursts. We used optical spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey(SDSS) to estimate the properties of the starbursts, inferring average ages of 200 Myrs and burst fractions involving \~{}10\% of their stellar mass. The COS data reveal highly ionized gas traced by CIV in 80\%(4/5) of the starburst and in 17\%(2/12) of the control sample. The two control galaxies with CIV absorbers differed from the four starbursts in showing multiple low-ionization transitions and strong saturated Lyman-alpha lines. They therefore appear to be physically different systems. We show that the CIV absorbers in the starburst CGM represent a significant baryon repository. The high detection rate of this highly ionized material in the starbursts suggests that starburst-driven winds can affect the CGM out to radii as large as 200 kpc. This is plausible given the inferred properties of the starbursts and the known properties of starburst-driven winds. This would represent the first direct observational evidence of local starbursts impacting the bulk of their gaseous halos, and as such provides new evidence of the importance of this kind of feedback in the evolution of galaxies.},

abstract = {SPT-CLJ2040-4451 -- spectroscopically confirmed at z = 1.478 -- is the highest redshift galaxy cluster yet discovered via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. SPT-CLJ2040-4451 was identified in the first 720 deg\^{}2 of the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SPT-SZ) survey, and confirmed in follow-up imaging and spectroscopy. From multi-object spectroscopy with Magellan-I/Baade+IMACS we measure spectroscopic redshifts for 15 cluster member galaxies, all of which have strong [O II] 3727 emission. SPT-CLJ2040-4451 has an SZ-measured mass of M\_500,SZ = 3.2 +/- 0.8 X 10\^{}14 M\_Sun/h\_70, corresponding to M\_200,SZ = 5.8 +/- 1.4 X 10\^{}14 M\_Sun/h\_70. The velocity dispersion measured entirely from blue star forming members is sigma\_v = 1500 +/- 520 km/s. The prevalence of star forming cluster members (galaxies with > 1.5 M\_Sun/yr) implies that this massive, high-redshift cluster is experiencing a phase of active star formation, and supports recent results showing a marked increase in star formation occurring in galaxy clusters at z >1.4. We also compute the probability of finding a cluster as rare as this in the SPT-SZ survey to be >99.5\%, indicating that its discovery is not in tension with the concordance Lambda-CDM cosmological model.},

abstract = {X-ray observations of galaxy clusters potentially provide powerful cosmological probes if systematics due to our incomplete knowledge of the intracluster medium (ICM) physics are understood and controlled. In this paper, we present mock Chandra analyses of cosmological cluster simulations and assess X-ray measurements of galaxy cluster properties using a model and procedure essentially identical to that used in real data analysis. We show that reconstruction of three-dimensional ICM density and temperature profiles is excellent for relaxed clusters, but still reasonably accurate for unrelaxed systems. The total ICM mass is measured quite accurately (<6\%) in all clusters, while the hydrostatic estimate of the gravitationally bound mass is biased low by about 5\%-20\% through the virial region, primarily due to additional pressure support provided by subsonic bulk motions in the ICM, ubiquitous in our simulations even in relaxed systems. Gas fraction determinations are therefore biased high; the bias increases toward cluster outskirts and depends sensitively on its dynamical state, but we do not observe significant trends of the bias with cluster mass or redshift. We also find that different average ICM temperatures, such as the X-ray spectroscopic Tspec and gas-mass-weighted Tmg, are related to each other by a constant factor with a relatively small object-to-object scatter and no systematic trend with mass, redshift or the dynamical state of clusters. We briefly discuss direct applications of our results for different cluster-based cosmological tests.},

abstract = {X-ray observations of galaxy clusters provide emission measure weighted spectra, arising from a range of density and temperature fluctuations in the intra-cluster medium (ICM). This is fitted to a single temperature plasma emission model to provide an estimate of the gas density and temperature, which are sensitive to the gas inhomogeneities. Therefore, X-ray observations yield a potentially biased estimate of the thermal gas pressure, P\_X. At the same time Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) observations directly measure the integrated gas pressure, P\_SZ. If the X-ray pressure profiles are strongly biased with respect to the SZ, then one has the possibility to probe the gas inhomogeneities, even at scales unresolved by the current generation of telescopes. At the same time, a weak bias has implications for the interchangeable use of mass proxies like Y\_SZ and Y\_X as cosmological probes. In this paper we investigate the dependence of the bias, defined as b\_P(r)=P\_X(r)/P\_SZ(r)-1, on the characteristics of fluctuations in the ICM taking into account the correlation between temperature and density fluctuations. We made a simple prediction of the irreducible bias in idealised X-ray vs SZ observations using multi-temperature plasma emission model. We also provide a simple fitting form to estimate the bias given the distribution of fluctuations. Analysing a sample of 16 clusters extracted from hydrodynamical simulations, we find that the median value of bias is within +/-3\% within R\_500, it decreases to -5\% at R\_500<r<1.5R\_500 and then rises back to \~{}0\% at r >\~{} 2R\_500. The scatter of b\_P(r) between individual relaxed clusters is small -- at the level of <0.03 within R\_500, but turns significantly larger (0.25) and highly skewed at r>\~{} 1.5R\_500. For any relaxed cluster we find |b\_P(r)| < 15\% within R\_500, across different implementations of input physics in the simulations. [abridged]},

abstract = {Observations of clusters of galaxies suggest that they contain significantly fewer baryons (gas plus stars) than the cosmic baryon fraction. This `missing baryon' puzzle is especially surprising for the most massive clusters which are expected to be representative of the cosmic matter content of the universe (baryons and dark matter). Here we show that the baryons may not actually be missing from clusters, but rather are extended to larger radii than typically observed. The baryon deficiency is typically observed in the central regions of clusters (\~{}0.5 the virial radius). However, the observed gas-density profile is significantly shallower than the mass-density profile, implying that the gas is more extended than the mass and that the gas fraction increases with radius. We use the observed density profiles of gas and mass in clusters to extrapolate the measured baryon fraction as a function of radius and as a function of cluster mass. We find that the baryon fraction reaches the cosmic value near the virial radius for all groups and clusters above 5e13 solar masses. This suggests that the baryons are not missing, they are simply located in cluster outskirts. Heating processes (shock-heating of the intracluster gas, plus supernovae and AGN feedback) that cause the gas to expand are likely explanations for these results. Upcoming observations should be able to detect these baryons.},

We find that detections of H I surrounding ETGs are typically as common and strong as around star-forming galaxies, implying that the total mass of circumgalactic material is comparable in the two populations. For ETGs, the covering fraction for H I absorption above 1016 cm-2 is \~{}40\%-50\% within \~{}150 kpc. Line widths and kinematics of the detected material show it to be cold (T <\~{} 105 K) in comparison to the virial temperature of the host halos. The implied masses of cool, photoionized circumgalactic medium baryons may be up to 109-1011 M ⊙. Contrary to some theoretical expectations, strong halo H I absorbers do not disappear as part of the quenching of star formation. Even passive galaxies retain significant reservoirs of halo baryons that could replenish the interstellar gas reservoir and eventually form stars. This halo gas may feed the diffuse and molecular gas that is frequently observed inside ETGs.

abstract = {The virialization shock around an X-ray cluster primarily heats the ions, since they carry most of the kinetic energy of the infalling gas. Subsequently, the ions share their thermal energy with the electrons through Coulomb collisions. We quantify the expected temperature difference between the electrons and ions as a function of radius and time, based on a spherical self-similar model for the accretion of gas by a cluster in an Omega=1, h=0.5 universe. Clusters with X-ray temperatures T=(4-10)*10\^{}7 K, show noticeable differences between their electron and ion temperatures at radii >2 Mpc. High resolution spectroscopy with future X-ray satellites such as Astro E may be able to determine the ion temperature in intracluster gas from the width of its X-ray emission lines, and compare it to the electron temperature as inferred from the free-free emission spectrum. Any difference between these temperatures can be used to date the period of time that has passed since the infalling gas joined the cluster.},

abstract = {In the cores of some clusters of galaxies the hot intracluster plasma is dense enough that it should cool radiatively in the cluster's lifetime, leading to continuous 'cooling flows' of gas sinking towards the cluster centre, yet no such cooling flow has been observed. The low observed star-formation rates and cool gas masses for these 'cool-core' clusters suggest that much of the cooling must be offset by feedback to prevent the formation of a runaway cooling flow. Here we report X-ray, optical and infrared observations of the galaxy cluster SPT-CLJ2344-4243 (ref. 11) at redshift z = 0.596. These observations reveal an exceptionally luminous (8.2 × 10(45) erg s(-1)) galaxy cluster that hosts an extremely strong cooling flow (around 3,820 solar masses a year). Further, the central galaxy in this cluster appears to be experiencing a massive starburst (formation of around 740 solar masses a year), which suggests that the feedback source responsible for preventing runaway cooling in nearby cool-core clusters may not yet be fully established in SPT-CLJ2344-4243. This large star-formation rate implies that a significant fraction of the stars in the central galaxy of this cluster may form through accretion of the intracluster medium, rather than (as is currently thought) assembling entirely via mergers.},

We use X-ray and SZ observations to determine the slope of the gas density profile to R200. This is shallower than the slope of total mass density (NFW) profile. We use the gas density slope to extrapolate the X-ray observations of gas fraction at R500 to the virial radius (R100). The gas fraction increases beyond R500 for all cluster masses. We add the stellar fraction as determined from COSMOS and 2MASS samples, with ICL contributing 10\% to the stellar fraction. For massive clusters (M500  7 × 1014M ), the baryon fraction reaches the cosmic baryon fraction at Rvir± 20\%. Poorer clusters and groups typically reach 75–85\% of the cosmic baryon fraction at the virial radius. We compare these results with simulations which take into account gravitational shock-heating, star formation, heating from SNe and AGN, and energy transfer from dark matter. We find that simulations explain the observed baryon fraction in low-mass clusters but underpredict the baryon fraction in massive clusters.},

Here, we use data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) to perform an independent estimate of the SZ decrement of maxBCG clusters. The recovered signal is consistent with that obtained using Planck, though with larger error bars due to WMAP's larger beam size and smaller frequency range. Nevertheless, this detection serves as an independent confirmation of the magnitude of the effect, and demonstrates that the observed discrepancy must be theoretical in origin.},

We investigate two approaches for partitioning gas into these constituents: a pressure-based and a metallicity-based recipe. We identify DLAs by passing lines of sight through our simulations to compute HI column densities. We find that models with "standard" gas radial profiles - where the average specific angular momentum of the gas disc is equal to that of the host dark matter halo - fail to reproduce the observed column density distribution of DLAs. These models also fail to reproduce the distribution of velocity widths \{$\backslash$Delta\}v, overproducing low \{$\backslash$Delta\}v relative to high \{$\backslash$Delta\}v systems. Models with "extended" radial gas profiles - corresponding to gas discs with higher specific angular momentum - are able to reproduce quite well the column density distribution of absorbers over the column density range 19 < log NHI < 22.5 in the redshift range 2 < z < 3.5. The model with pressure-based gas partitioning also reproduces the observed line density of DLAs, HI gas density, and \{$\backslash$Delta\}v distribution at z < 3 remarkably well. However all of the models investigated here underproduce DLAs and the HI gas density at z > 3. If this is the case, the flatness in the number of DLAs and HI gas density over the redshift interval 0 < z < 5 may be due to a cosmic coincidence where the majority of DLAs at z > 3 arise from intergalactic gas in filaments while those at z < 3 arise predominantly in galactic discs. We further investigate the dependence of DLA metallicity on redshift and \{$\backslash$Delta\}v, and find reasonably good agreement with the observations, particularly when including the effects of metallicity gradients (abbrv.).},

abstract = {We present South Pole Telescope (SPT) observations of the five galaxy cluster candidates in the southern hemisphere which were reported as unconfirmed in the Planck Early Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (ESZ) sample. One cluster candidate, PLCKESZ G255.62-46.16, is located in the 2500-square-degree SPT SZ survey region and was reported previously as SPT-CL J0411-4819. For the remaining four candidates, which are located outside of the SPT SZ survey region, we performed short, dedicated SPT observations. Each of these four candidates was strongly detected in maps made from these observations, with signal-to-noise ratios ranging from 6.3 to 13.8. We have observed these four candidates on the Magellan-Baade telescope and used these data to estimate cluster redshifts from the red sequence. Resulting redshifts range from 0.24 to 0.46. We report measurements of Y\_0.75', the integrated Comptonization within a 0.75' radius, for all five candidates. We also report X-ray luminosities calculated from ROSAT All-Sky Survey catalog counts, as well as optical and improved SZ coordinates for each candidate. The combination of SPT SZ measurements, optical red-sequence measurements, and X-ray luminosity estimates demonstrates that these five Planck ESZ cluster candidates do indeed correspond to real galaxy clusters with redshifts and observable properties consistent with the rest of the ESZ sample.},

abstract = {The South Pole Telescope (SPT) is currently surveying 2500 deg\^{}2 of the southern sky to detect massive galaxy clusters out to the epoch of their formation using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. This paper presents a catalog of the 26 most significant SZ cluster detections in the full survey region. The catalog includes 14 clusters which have been previously identified and 12 that are new discoveries. These clusters were identified in fields observed to two differing noise depths: 1500 deg\^{}2 at the final SPT survey depth of 18 uK-arcmin at 150 GHz, and 1000 deg\^{}2 at a depth of 54 uK-arcmin. Clusters were selected on the basis of their SZ signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in SPT maps, a quantity which has been demonstrated to correlate tightly with cluster mass. The S/N thresholds were chosen to achieve a comparable mass selection across survey fields of both depths. Cluster redshifts were obtained with optical and infrared imaging and spectroscopy from a variety of ground- and space-based facilities. The redshifts range from 0.098 $\backslash$leq z $\backslash$leq 1.132 with a median of z\_med = 0.40. The measured SZ S/N and redshifts lead to unbiased mass estimates ranging from 9.8 $\backslash$times 10\^{}14 M\_sun/h\_70 $\backslash$leq M\_200(rho\_mean) $\backslash$leq 3.1 $\backslash$times 10\^{}15 M\_sun/h\_70. Based on the SZ mass estimates, we find that none of the clusters are individually in significant tension with the LambdaCDM cosmological model. We also test for evidence of non-Gaussianity based on the cluster sample and find the data show no preference for non-Gaussian perturbations.},

abstract = {We study relation between stellar mass and halo mass for high-mass halos using a sample of galaxy clusters with accurate measurements of stellar masses from optical and IR data and total masses from X-ray observations. We find that stellar mass of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) scales as M*BCG$\backslash$propto M500\^{}a\_BCG with the best fit slope of a\_BCG\~{}0.35+-0.1 and scatter of M*BCG at a fixed M500 of \~{}0.2 dex. We show that M*-M relations from abundance matching or halo modelling reported in recent studies underestimate stellar masses of BCGs by a factor of \~{}2-4, because these studies used stellar mass functions (SMF) based on photometry that severely underestimates the outer surface brightness profiles of massive galaxies. We show that M*-M relation derived using abundance matching with the recent SMF calibration by Bernardi et al. (2013) based on improved photometry is in a much better agreement with the relation we derive. The total stellar mass of galaxies correlates with total mass M500 with the slope of $\backslash$approx 0.6+-0.1 and scatter of 0.1 dex. This indicates that efficiency with which baryons are converted into stars decreases with increasing cluster mass. We show that for a fixed choice of the initial mass function (IMF) total stellar fraction in clusters is only a factor of \~{}3-5 lower than the peak stellar fraction reached in M$\backslash$approx 10\^{}12 Msun halos, and only a factor of \~{}1.5-3 if the IMF becomes progressively more bottom heavy with increasing mass in early type galaxies, as indicated by recent observations. The larger normalization and slope of the M*-M relation derived in this study shows that the overall efficiency of star formation in massive halos is suppressed much less than was thought before and that feedback and associated suppression of star formation in massive halos should be weaker than assumed in most of the current semi-analytic models and simulations.},

abstract = {We aim at investigating potential biases in lensing and X-ray methods to measure the cluster mass profiles. We do so by performing realistic simulations of lensing and X-ray observations that are subsequently analyzed using observational techniques. The resulting mass estimates are compared among them and with the input models. Three clusters obtained from state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations, each of which has been projected along three independent lines-of-sight, are used for this analysis. We find that strong lensing models can be trusted over a limited region around the cluster core. Extrapolating the strong lensing mass models to outside the Einstein ring can lead to significant biases in the mass estimates, if the BCG is not modeled properly for example. Weak lensing mass measurements can be largely affected by substructures, depending on the method implemented to convert the shear into a mass estimate. Using non-parametric methods which combine weak and strong lensing data, the projected masses within R200 can be constrained with a precision of \~{}10\%. De-projection of lensing masses increases the scatter around the true masses by more than a factor of two due to cluster triaxiality. X-ray mass measurements have much smaller scatter (about a factor of two smaller than the lensing masses) but they are generally biased low by 5-20\%. This bias is ascribable to bulk motions in the gas of our simulated clusters. Using the lensing and the X-ray masses as proxies for the true and the hydrostatic equilibrium masses of the simulated clusters and averaging over the cluster sample we are able to measure the lack of hydrostatic equilibrium in the systems we have investigated.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the MgII 2796, 2803 and FeII 2586, 2600 absorption line profiles in individual spectra of 105 galaxies at 0.3<z<1.4. The galaxies, drawn from redshift surveys of the GOODS fields and the Extended Groth Strip, fully sample the range in star formation rates (SFRs) occupied by the star-forming sequence with stellar masses log M\_*/M\_sun > 9.5 at 0.3<z<0.7. Using the Doppler shifts of the MgII and FeII absorption lines as tracers of cool gas kinematics, we detect large-scale winds in 66+/-5\% of the galaxies. HST/ACS imaging and our spectral analysis indicate that the outflow detection rate depends primarily on galaxy orientation: winds are detected in \~{}89\% of galaxies having inclinations (i) <30 degrees (face-on), while the wind detection rate is only \~{}45\% in objects having i>50 degrees (edge-on). Combined with the comparatively weak dependence of the wind detection rate on intrinsic galaxy properties, this suggests that biconical outflows are ubiquitous in normal, star-forming galaxies at z\~{}0.5. We find that the wind velocity is correlated with host galaxy M\_* at 3.4-sigma significance, while the equivalent width of the flow is correlated with host galaxy SFR at 3.5-sigma significance, suggesting that hosts with higher SFR may launch more material into outflows and/or generate a larger velocity spread for the absorbing clouds. Assuming that the gas is launched into dark matter halos with simple, isothermal density profiles, the wind velocities measured for the bulk of the cool material (\~{}200-400 km/s) are sufficient to enable escape from the halo potentials only for the lowest-M\_* systems in the sample. However, the outflows typically carry sufficient energy to reach distances of >50 kpc, and may therefore be a viable source of cool material for the massive circumgalactic medium observed around bright galaxies at z\~{}0.

CGM warm cloud properties are derived, including volume filling factors of 3-5\%, cloud sizes of 0.1-30 kpc, masses of 10-1e8 solar masses and metallicities of 0.1-1 times solar. Almost all warm CGM clouds within 0.5 virial radii are metal-bearing and many have velocities consistent with being bound, "galactic fountain" clouds. For galaxies with L > 0.1 L*, the total mass in these warm CGM clouds approaches 1e10 solar masses, \~{}10-15\% of the total baryons in massive spirals and comparable to the baryons in their parent galaxy disks. This leaves >50\% of massive spiral-galaxy baryons "missing". Dwarfs (<0.1 L*) have smaller area covering factors and warm CGM masses (<5\% baryon fraction), suggesting that many of their warm clouds escape. Constant warm cloud internal pressures as a function of impact parameter (\$P/k \~{} 10 cm\^{}\{-3\} K) support the inference that previous COS detections of broad, shallow O VI and Ly-alpha absorptions are of an extensive (\~{}400-600 kpc), hot (T \~{} 1e6 K) intra-cloud gas which is very massive (>1e11 solar masses).

abstract = {Using sensitive centimeter-wave receivers mounted on the Owens Valley Radio Observatory and Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland-Association millimeter arrays, we have obtained interferometric measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect toward massive galaxy clusters. We use the SZ data to determine the pressure distribution of the cluster gas and, in combination with published X-ray temperatures, to infer the gas mass and total gravitational mass of 18 clusters. The gas mass fraction, f\_g, is calculated for each cluster, and is extrapolated to the fiducial radius r\_\{500\} using the results of numerical simulations. The mean f\_g within r\_\{500\} is 0.081+0.009 -0.011/(h\_\{100\} (statistical uncertainty at 68\% confidence level, assuming OmegaM=0.3, OmegaL=0.7). We discuss possible sources of systematic errors in the mean f\_g measurement. We derive an upper limit for OmegaM from this sample under the assumption that the mass composition of clusters within r\_\{500\} reflects the universal mass composition: Omega\_M h < Omega\_B/f\_g. The gas mass fractions depend on cosmology through the angular diameter distance and the r\_\{500\} correction factors. For a flat universe (OmegaL = 1 - OmegaM) and h=0.7, we find the measured gas mass fractions are consistent with Omegam less than 0.40, at 68\% confidence. Including estimates of the baryons contained in galaxies and the baryons which failed to become bound during the cluster formation process, we find OmegaM $\backslash$\~{}0.25.},

abstract = {How is mass distributed in the universe? How does it compare with the distribution of light and stars? We address these questions by examining the distribution of mass, determined from weak lensing observations, and starlight, around > 10\^{}5 SDSS MaxBCG groups and clusters as a function of environment and scale, from deep inside clusters to large cosmic scales of 22 h\^{}-1 Mpc (Sheldon et al. 2009a). The observed cumulative mass-to-light profile, M/L (< r), rises on small scales, reflecting the increasing M/L of the central bright galaxy of the cluster, then flattens to a nearly constant ratio on scales above \~{} 300 h\^{}-1 kpc, where light follows mass on all scales and in all environments. A trend of slightly decreasing M/L (r) with scale is shown to be consistent with the varying stellar population following the morphology-density relation. This suggests that stars trace mass remarkably well even though they represent only a few percent of the total mass. We determine the stellar mass fraction and find it to be nearly constant on all scales above \~{} 300 h\^{}-1 kpc, with M\_*/M\_tot = 1.0 +/- 0.4\%. We further suggest that most of the dark matter in the universe is located in the large halos of individual galaxies (\~{} 300 kpc for L* galaxies) and show that the entire M/L (r) profile -- from groups and clusters to large-scale structure -- can be accounted for by the aggregate masses of the individual galaxies, plus gas. We use the observed mass-to-light ratio on large scales to determine the mass density of the universe: Omega\_m = 0.24 +/- 0.02 x b\^{}2\_M/L = 0.26 +/- 0.02.},

abstract = {We report the detection of CO(1-0) line emission in the bright, lensed star-forming galaxies SPT-S 233227-5358.5 (z=2.73) and SPT-S 053816-5030.8 (z=2.78), using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). Both galaxies were discovered in a large-area millimeter survey with the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and found to be gravitationally lensed by intervening structures. The measured CO intensities imply galaxies with molecular gas masses of (3.2 $\backslash$pm 0.5)x10\^{}10 (mu/15)\^{}\{-1\}(X\_CO/0.8) M\_sun and (1.7 $\backslash$pm 0.3)x10\^{}10 (mu/20)\^{}\{-1\}(X\_CO/0.8) M\_sun, and gas depletion timescales of 4.9x10\^{}7 (X\_CO/0.8) yr and 2.6x10\^{}7 (X\_CO/0.8) yr, respectively, where mu corresponds to the lens magnification and X\_CO is the CO luminosity to gas mass conversion factor. In the case of SPT-S 053816-5030.8, we also obtained significant detections of the rest-frame 115.7 and 132.4 GHz radio continuum. Based on the radio to infrared spectral energy distribution and an assumed synchrotron spectral index, we find that 42 $\backslash$pm 10 \% and 55 $\backslash$pm 13 \% of the flux at rest-frame 115.7 and 132.4 GHz arise from free-free emission. We find a radio-derived intrinsic star formation rate (SFR) of 470 $\backslash$pm 170 M\_sun/yr, consistent within the uncertainties with the infrared estimate. Based on the morphology of this object in the source plane, the derived gas mass and the possible flattening of the radio spectral index towards low frequencies, we argue that SPT-S 053816-5030.8 exhibits properties compatible with a scaled-up local ultra-luminous infrared galaxy.},

abstract = {We present new results on the kinematics and spatial distribution of metal-enriched gas within 125 kpc (physical) of Lyman Break galaxies at redshifts z\~{}2-3. In particular, we demonstrate how rest-UV galaxy spectra can be used to obtain key spatial and spectral information more efficiently than possible with QSO sightlines. After recalibrating the measurement of galaxy systemic redshifts from their UV spectra, we investigate the kinematics of galaxy-scale outflows via the strong interstellar (IS) absorption and Lya emission lines (when present), as well as their dependence on other physical properties of the galaxies. We construct a sample of 512 close (1-15 arcsec) angular pairs of z\~{}2-3 LBGs in which the spectra background galaxies probe the circumgalactic gas surrrounding those in the foreground. The close pairs, together with spectra of the foreground galaxies themselves, sample galactocentric impact parameters b=0-125 kpc (physical) at <z>=2.2. The ensemble provides a spatial map of cool gas as a function of galactocentric distance for a well-characterized population of galaxies. We propose a simple model that simultaneously matches the kinematics, depth, and profile shape of IS absorption and Lya emission lines, as well as the observed variation of absorption line strength (of HI, CII, CIV, SiII, SiIV) versus galactocentric impact parameter. We discuss the results of the observations in the context of "cold accretion", in which cool gas accretes via filamentary streams directly onto the central regions of galaxies. At present, we find little observational support for cool infalling material, whereas evidence supporting the large-scale effects of outflows is strong. Reconciling theory and observation on the subject of gas flows into and out of forming galaxies seems necessary.},

These data are well described by simple photoionization models, with the gas highly ionized (n\_HII/n\_H > 99\%) by the extragalactic ultraviolet background (EUVB). Scaling by estimates for the virial radius, R\_vir, we show that the ionization state (tracked by the dimensionless ionization parameter, U) increases with distance from the host galaxy. This correlation has a power-law form of U = (0.006 +/- 0.003)(R/R\_vir)\^{}(0.8 +/- 0.3), with significant scatter. The ionization parameters imply a decreasing volume density profile n\_ H = 10\^{}(-4.2 +/- 0.25) (R/R\_vir)\^{}(-0.8 +/-0.3). Our derived gas volume densities are several orders of magnitude lower than predictions from standard two-phase models with a cool medium in pressure equilibrium with a hot, diffuse medium. Applying the ionization corrections to the HI column densities, we estimate a lower limit to the cool gas mass M\_ CGMcool > 6.5 x 10\^{}10 M\_sun for the volume within R < R\_vir. Allowing for an additional warm, OVI-traced phase, the CGM accounts for *at least* half of the baryons purported to be missing from galaxy dark matter halos.},

abstract = {New, high resolution, large-scale, cosmological hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations of a standard cold dark matter model (with a cosmological constant) are utilized to predict the distribution of baryons at the present and at moderate redshift. It is found that the average temperature of baryons is an increasing function of time, with most of the baryons at the present time having a temperature in the range 10\^{}\{5-7\} K. Thus, not only is the universe dominated by dark matter, but more than one half of the normal matter is yet to be detected. Detection of this warm/hot gas poses an observational challenge, requiring sensitive EUV and X-ray satellites. Signatures include a soft, cosmic X-ray background, apparent warm components in hot clusters due to both intrinsic warm intra-cluster gas and warm inter-cluster gas projected onto clusters along the line of sight, absorption lines in X-ray and UV quasar spectra [e.g., O VI (1032,1038)A lines, OVII 574 eV line], strong emission lines (e.g., O VIII 653 eV line) and low redshift, broad, low column density \$\backslash lya\$ absorption lines. We estimate that approximately 1/4 of the extragalactic soft X-ray background (SXRB) (at 0.7 keV) arises from the warm/hot gas, half of it coming from \$z<0.65\$ and three-quarters from \$z<1.00\$, so the source regions should be identifiable on deep optical images.},

abstract = {We present the design and methods of the COS-Halos survey, a systematic investigation of the gaseous halos of 44 z = 0.15-0.35 galaxies using background QSOs observed with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. This survey has yielded 39 spectra of z\_em \~{} 0.5 QSOs with S/N \~{} 10-15 per resolution element. The QSO sightlines pass within 150 physical kpc of the galaxies, which span early and late types over stellar mass log M* / Msun= 9.5 - 11.5. We find that the CGM exhibits strong HI, averaging 1 Ang in Lya equivalent width out to 150 kpc, with 100\% covering fraction for star-forming galaxies and 75\% covering for passive galaxies. We find good agreement in column densities between this survey and previous studies over similar range of impact parameter. There is weak evidence for a difference between early- and late-type galaxies in the strength and distribution of HI. Kinematics indicate that the detected material is bound to the host galaxy, such that >\~{}90\% of the detected column density is confined within +/-200 km s\^{}-1 of the galaxies. This material generally exists well below the halo virial temperatures at T<\~{} 10\^{}5 K. We evaluate a number of possible origin scenarios for the detected material, and in the end favor a simple model in which the bulk of the detected HI arises in a bound, cool, low-density photoionized diffuse medium that is generic to all L* galaxies and may harbor a total gaseous mass comparable to galactic stellar masses.},

Additionally, the fraction of the total gravitating mass in the universe which is contained in intracluster gas is quantified. Furthermore, physical properties of the cluster sample have been studied and analyses of relations between different cluster parameters (including the gas mass fraction, gas temperature, X-ray luminosity, gas mass, gravitational mass, beta, and core radius) are discussed. Also, results from an analysis of XMM-Newton performance verification phase data of Abell 1835 are described.},

abstract = {We measure the thermodynamic properties of cluster outer regions to provide constraints on the processes that rule the formation of large scale structures. We derived the thermodynamic properties of the intracluster gas (temperature, entropy) by combining the SZ thermal pressure from Planck and the X-ray gas density from ROSAT. This method allowed us to reconstruct for the first time temperature and entropy profiles out to the virial radius and beyond in a large sample of objects. At variance with several recent Suzaku studies, we find that the entropy rises steadily with radius, albeit at at a somewhat lower rate than predicted by self-similar expectations. We note significant differences between relaxed, cool-core systems and unrelaxed clusters in the outer regions. Relaxed systems appear to follow the self-similar expectations more closely than perturbed objects. Our results indicate that the well-known entropy excess observed in cluster cores extends well beyond the central regions. When correcting for the gas depletion, the observed entropy profiles agree with the prediction from gravitational collapse only, especially for cool-core clusters.},

With robust background subtraction and modeling, we trace gas properties to at least r 2500 for all 43 groups. For 11 groups, gas properties can be robustly derived to r 500. For an additional 12 groups, we derive gas properties to at least r 1000 and estimate properties at r 500 from extrapolation. We show that in spite of the large variation in temperature profiles inside 0.15 r 500, the temperature profiles of these groups are similar at > 0.15 r 500 and are consistent with a "universal temperature profile." We present the K-T relations at six characteristic radii (30 kpc, 0.15 r 500, r 2500, r 1500, r 1000, and r 500), for 43 groups from this work and 14 clusters from the Vikhlinin et al. (2008) sample. Despite large scatter in the entropy values at 30 kpc and 0.15 r 500, the intrinsic scatter at r 2500 is much smaller and remains the same (\~{} 10\%) to r 500. The entropy excess at r 500 is confirmed, in both groups and clusters, but the magnitude is smaller than previous ROSAT and ASCA results. We also present scaling relations for the gas fraction. It appears that the average gas fraction between r 2500 and r 500 has no temperature dependence, \~{} 0.12 for 1-10 keV systems. The group gas fractions within r 2500 are generally low and have large scatter. This work shows that the difference of groups from hotter clusters stems from the difficulty of compressing group gas inside of r 2500. The large scatter of the group gas fraction within r 2500 causes large scatter in the group entropy around the center and may be responsible for the large scatter of the group luminosities. Nevertheless, the groups appear more regular and more like clusters beyond r 2500 from the results on gas fraction and entropy. Therefore, mass proxies can be extended into low-mass systems. The M 500-T 500 and M 500-Y X,500 relations derived in this work are indeed well behaved down to at least 2 ×1013 h-1 M sun.},
