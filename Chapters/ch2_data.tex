\section{Total Mass in Groups and Clusters}
\label{sec:Mass}

The total mass in groups and clusters can be measured in a number
of ways. The most direct method of calculating the mass profile of a
large halo is through gravitational lensing of the light of background
sources behind the halo. Strong gravitational lensing occurs when the
background object (ex: a high-redshift galaxy) is magnified and
severely warped by the gravitational potential of the lens (foreground
cluster). This allows a very accurate measurement of the mass of the
lens, but occurs only rarely when the background/foreground are in a
particular alignment. More commonly utilized is the technique of weak
gravitational lensing
\citeeg{Umetsu2009,Sheldon2009a,VonderLinden2014}, where small
distortions of an immense number of background objects are used to
statistically determine the mass profile of a foreground halo.

Another common method of estimating the mass of groups and clusters is
through the assumption of \textit{hydrostatic equilibrium} (HSE). If
the gas in clusters is in HSE, then the pressure gradient offsets the
gravitational force:
\begin{align}
\frac{d\textrm{P(\textrm{r})}}{d\textrm{r}} &=
-\frac{\textrm{GM}(<\textrm{r})\rho(\textrm{r})}{\textrm{r}^2}
\nonumber
\end{align}
Therefore, assuming the ICM is in hydrostatic
  equilibrium, the total mass profile can be reconstructed from the
  observed gas density and pressure profiles:
\begin{align}
 \textrm{M}(<\textrm{r}) &=
 -\frac{\textrm{r}^2}{\textrm{G}~\rho_{gas}(\textrm{r})}\frac{d\textrm{P}(<\textrm{r})}{d\textrm{r}}\nonumber
 \intertext{Alternatively, the total mass can be calculated using the
   density and temperature profiles, assuming the ICM behaves as an
   ideal gas, P(r)=n(r)kT(r):} \textrm{M}(<\textrm{r}) &=
 -\frac{k~\textrm{T}(\textrm{r})~\textrm{r}}{\textrm{G}}\left(\frac{d\log{\rho_{gas}(\textrm{r})}}{d\textrm{r}}
 + \frac{d\log{\textrm{T}(\textrm{r})}}{d\textrm{r}}\right)\nonumber
\end{align} 
Gas density is typically measured using X-ray observations, as the gas
density is easily calculated from the X-ray surface
brightness. Temperature can be determined spectroscopically from X-ray
observations, and pressure can be measured directly through the
thermal SZ effect. 

The accuracy of the total mass derived through the assumption of
hydrostatic equilibrium (or the ``hydrostatic mass'') is highly
debated, as sources of non-thermal pressure (including cosmic rays,
merger-induced shocks, and AGN feedback) can invalidate the assumption
of hydrostatic equilibrium. Additionally, deviations from spherical
symmetry can bias hydrostatic mass estimates, as many gas measurements
are sensitive to the integrated profile along the
line-of-sight. Comparing hydrostatic masses to masses derived through
weak-lensing analysis can help constrain the bias inherent in the HSE
assumption, although weak-lensing masses are also sensitive to the
ellipticity of clusters.

The total matter density distribution is often modeled by the NFW
profile, an analytical equation first proposed by \citet{Navarro1996}
to describe the ``universal density profile'' of simulated dark matter
halos, regardless of size. The NFW profile has the form:
\begin{equation}
\rho_m(\radius) = \frac{\delta_c\rhocrit}{(\textrm{r/r}_s)(1 + \textrm{r/r}_s)^2}~.\nonumber
\end{equation}
r$_s$ is a characteristic radius representing the central core of the
dark matter halo, $\rhocrit$ is the critical matter density, and
$\delta_c$ is a normalization constant which sets the characteristic
overdensity of the cluster. Halos which fit the NFW profile are
self-similar, in that only $\radius_s$ is dependent on mass. When
$\radius \approx \radius_s$, the density profile decreases slowly
($\rho_m \propto \radius^{-1}$), while at $\radius \gg \radius_s$ the
profile steepens to $\rho_m \propto \radius^{-3}$. Observations of
group and cluster halos consistently find that the total mass profile
follows the NFW profile well
\citeeg{Vikhlinin2006,Mandelbaum2008,Sheldon2009a,Umetsu2009}.

Several ``mass proxies'' have been used to estimate the total mass of
clusters. Mass proxies are typically easily-observed quantities that
are found to correlate strongly with the total cluster mass. Examples
include the X-ray temperature ($\textrm{kT}_\textrm{X}\approx1$ -- $10$ \keV{}
for groups and clusters), the richness (number of bright
galaxies observed within the cluster), and $\textrm{Y}_{\textrm{X}} =
\Mass_{gas}\textrm{T}_\textrm{X}$. Using mass proxies allows observers
to place general constraints on the mass of a cluster without
requiring deep observations to recover the true gas or mass density
profiles. The assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium can also affect
the determination of mass through this method, as many Mass-Proxy
relations are calibrated against hydrostatic masses of clusters
\citeeg{Arnaud2007,Arnaud2010}.

\section{Cluster Gas Mass Fraction}
\label{sec:Gas}
The baryonic content of galaxy groups and clusters is dominated by hot
gas in the intracluster medium (ICM). Until very recently, the most
sensitive X-ray and SZ observations were only able to constrain the
gas mass in the ICM in the inner regions of groups and clusters,
typically to around \rfive{} \citeeg{Vikhlinin2006, Arnaud2007,
  Sun2009}. \todo{Any more?} Because \rvir{} is about twice \rfive{},
these observations only probe the inner $\sim \frac{1}{8}$ of the
virial volume of group and cluster halos. In order to measure the
baryon fraction within groups and clusters, it is essential to
consider the gas within a volume substantially larger than that within
\rfive{}. Here, we describe the relevant observations of groups and
clusters which measure both the ICM and total mass to the outskirts of
the dark matter halo. Because very few telescopes retain the
sensitivity required to measure the gas density in the outskirts of
clusters, we also discuss a method of using observed gas density
profiles to extrapolate observed gas fractions to higher radii.

\subsection{Observations}
\label{sec:Gas.Observations}
\textbf{\citet{Vikhlinin2006}} derived the gas and total mass profiles
of 10 low-redshift (median redshift z$ = 0.06$) relaxed clusters using
long-exposure \textit{Chandra} observations. The clusters have a
median mass $\Mvir = 7.3 \power{14}$ \Msun, and range from $\Mvir =
1.1\power{14}$ -- $1.5 \power{15}$ \Msun. Temperatures range from $\textrm{kT}
= 2$ -- $9$ \keV. The authors measured X-ray temperature and surface
brightness profiles to approximately \rfive{}. They modeled the
surface brightness profile (which is proportional to n$_e$n$_p$) to
recover the gas particle density, $\rho_{gas}($r$)$. The total mass
(\Mfive) was derived by solving the equation of hydrostatic
equilibrium, using the observed density and temperature profiles, and
is well-fit by an NFW profile in most cases. The integrated gas
density and total mass profiles were used to derive the gas fraction
interior to \rfive{}, $\fg(<\rfive)$. This gas fraction ranges widely
from cluster to cluster, from $6\%$ to $14\%$, with median
$11\%$. These observations were also used to derive a useful scaling
relation between \Mfive{} and the X-ray temperature T:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:M-T}
\Mfive{} = (2.97 \pm 0.15)\times10^{14}~\Msun~h_{70}^{-1}
\left(\frac{\textrm{T}}{5~\textrm{keV}}\right)^{1.58 \pm 0.11}.
\end{equation}

\textbf{\citet{Arnaud2007}} used very similar methods to derive the
gas and total mass profiles of 10 low-redshift (median redshift z$ =
0.09$) relaxed clusters from \textit{XMM-Newton} observations. The
clusters range in mass from $\Mvir = 1.2\power{14}$ -- $1.16 \power{15}$ \Msun,
with a median of $4.2 \power{14}$ \Msun, and temperatures vary from
$\textrm{kT} = 2$ -- $8$ \keV. The total mass also relies on
the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, and was extrapolated from
$\sim$r$_{700}$ to \rfive{} using an NFW profile.  \fg{} was derived
out to \rfive{} for these clusters, varying from $5.5\%$ to $16\%$,
with median $11\%$, similar to the \citet{Vikhlinin2006} measurements.

\textbf{\citet{Sun2009}} analyzed the gas fraction in 43 groups from
archival \textit{Chandra} observations. All the groups are at low
redshifts ($z \lsim 0.1$). Of these 43 observations, 11 were sensitive
enough to measure the X-ray surface brightness to \rfive{}, while an
additional 12 measured surface brightness to r$_{1000}$ and were
extrapolated to \rfive{}. The total mass of the 23 best-measured
groups ranges from $\Mvir = 2.0\power{13}$ -- $2.1 \power{14}$ \Msun, with a
median of $1.1 \power{14}$ \Msun, and ICM temperatures range from
$\textrm{kT} = 0.7$ -- $2.7 \keV$. The total mass (assuming hydrostatic
equilibrium) and gas mass were calculated using similar principles to
\citet{Vikhlinin2006}, with errors estimated by using 1000 artificial
profiles generated from Monte-Carlo simulations. $\fg(<\rfive)$ for
these 23 groups ranges from $5\%$ -- $11\%$, with a median of $8\%$,
lower than for the more massive clusters of \citet{Vikhlinin2006} and
\citet{Arnaud2007}.

The above three samples were combined in the analysis of
\textbf{\citet{Giodini2009}} (G09), which used all 10 clusters from
\citet{Vikhlinin2006}, all 10 clusters from \citet{Arnaud2007}, and 21
of the 23 best-measured groups from \citet{Sun2009} to study the
group/cluster gas mass fraction over a wide range of halo masses. The
authors bin the 42 groups and clusters logarithmically by mass,
highlighting that lower mass halos have significantly lower gas
fractions. The best-fit trend is:
\begin{equation}
\fg(<\rfive) = (9.3 \pm 0.2)\power{-2}~h_{70}^{-3/2}~
\left(\frac{\Mfive}{2\power{14}\Msun}\right)^{0.21 \pm 0.03}.
\end{equation}
Figure \ref{fig:Giodini_Fgas} shows the distribution of the observed
gas fractions, as a function of halo mass, measured by the three works
above. We will use the G09 bins as 5 independent samples of \fg{} for
different masses. 

\input{Figures/Giodini_Fgas}

Recent results from the \Planck{} satellite detect the ICM using the
Thermal SZ effect, which measures the integrated line-of-sight gas
pressure. \textbf{\citet{PlanckIntV}} (PC13) derives a stacked pressure
profile for 62 massive clusters which have archival observations by
\XMM. The cluster sample \citep[detailed in][]{PlanckEarlyXI} includes
clusters of mass $\Mvir = 3.3\power{14}$ -- $2.7 \power{15}$ \Msun,
with median mass approximately $\Mvir = 8.70 \power{14}$ \Msun. X-ray
temperatures range from $\textrm{kT} = 3.4$ -- $13 \keV$. Total mass
(\Mfive) was derived from a scaling relation with the quantity
$\textrm{Y}_X = \textrm{M}_{gas}\textrm{T}_X$, an easily-observable
quantity that has been found to be a good mass proxy. The scaling
relation in question \citep{Arnaud2010} was calibrated against X-ray
derived hydrostatic masses, and so the total mass profile of the
stacked \Planck{} clusters assumes hydrostatic equilibrium. The total
mass beyond \rfive{} was calculated assuming an NFW profile. The
stacked pressure profile is measured to unprecedented scales ($3\rfive
\approx 1.6\rvir$), although the X-ray temperature profile measured by
\XMM{} only extends to \rfive{}, so the authors extrapolated the
observed temperature profile to $3\rfive{}$ to match the pressure
observations.

Assuming the ICM acts as an ideal gas ($\textrm{P} \propto
\textrm{n}_\textrm{e}\textrm{kT}$), the authors inverted the pressure
and temperature profiles to retrieve the gas density profile and
derive $\fg{}(\textrm{r})$ out to 3\rfive{}\footnote{The authors also
  derive the gas-fraction assuming a conservative case in which the
  ICM is isothermal beyond \rfive{}, resulting in lower \fg{}.}. The
reconstruction of the temperature profile was initially flawed, and
the correct gas fraction profile was given in a corrigendum,
\citet{PlanckIntVb}. \fg{} increases from \rfive{} to \rvir{}
\citep[as predicted by][see \ref{sec:Gas.Extrapolation}]{Rasheed2011},
reaching a peak of $\approx 15\pm2\%$ at $1.6\rvir{}$.

\textbf{\citet{Eckert2013b}} (E13) combined the stacked pressure profile
from \citet{PlanckIntV} with a stacked X-ray surface-brightness
profile that directly constrains the gas density to \rtwo{}. The X-ray
observations were performed with \Rosat{}, on a sample of 31 clusters
($z\lsim0.2$) of temperatures $\textrm{kT} = 2.5$ -- $9$ \keV, with
median $\textrm{kT} = 6.5$ \keV. The cluster masses range from $\Mvir
\approx 1.4 \power{14}$ to $1.0 \power{15} \Msun$, with median $\Mvir =
6.0\power{14} \Msun$\footnote{The authors do not give the masses of
  the clusters, so these values are taken from the M-T relation of
  \citet{Vikhlinin2006} (equation \ref{eq:M-T}).}. The \Planck{}
pressure profile, combined with the gas density profile, is used to
directly calculate the total mass, assuming hydrostatic
equilibrium. This is different from the method used by
\citet{PlanckIntV}, which assumed an NFW profile. However, both
estimates rely on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium either
explicitly or implicitly through calibration of the
$\textrm{Y}_\textrm{X}-\Mfive$ relation. 18
clusters are in common between the \Rosat{} and \Planck{} samples, and
the authors separate them into cool-core (CC, 6 clusters) and
non-cool core (NCC, 12 clusters) categories. The gas fraction profile
is calculated separately for the two categories, and the authors find
that NCC clusters have significantly higher gas fractions within
\rtwo{} ($0.169 \pm 0.010$) than relaxed, CC clusters do ($0.134\pm
0.011$), suggesting that the irregular, non-spherical morphologies of
the disturbed clusters may bias the gas fractions high. They also find
that \fg{} increases from \rfive{} to \rtwo{} ($\fg(<\rfive) \approx
0.12$ for CC clusters). 

\textbf{\citet{Umetsu2009}} (U09) observed the ICM of four very massive
($\Mvir \gsim 1\power{15}$ \Msun, $\textrm{kT} \approx 9$ -- $10$ \keV)
clusters using Thermal SZ measurements with the \textit{AMiBA} CMB
telescope. After deriving pressure profiles from the SZ effect, the
authors calculated the gas density profile using archival X-ray
temperature measurements and a theoretical temperature-profile
\citep{Komatsu2001}. The authors use \textit{Subaru} observations to
derive the cluster masses with weak-lensing analysis. The average gas
fraction is calculated to the limit of the SZ observations, \rtwo, and
is found to be $\fg(<\rfive) = 0.126 \pm 0.019 \pm 0.016$ within
\rfive{} and $\fg(<\rtwo) = 0.133 \pm 0.020 \pm 0.018$ within
\rtwo{}. The two uncertainties on each fraction are the statistical
error and cluster-to-cluster standard deviation, respectively. These
observations also find that \fg{} increases with radius beyond
\rfive{}, in agreement with \citet{PlanckIntV} and
\citet{Eckert2013b}. We emphasize that the total mass for these
clusters are \textit{not} dependent on the assumption of hydrostatic
equilibrium (because they were derived using weak-lensing
measurements), so comparisons of \fg{} from this sample to the same
value for samples which assume HSE can put constraints on the validity
of the HSE assumption.

Table \ref{tab:F_gas_obs} lists the observed data from the samples
described above, including the most important characteristics of each
sample: median mass ($\Mvir$), whether that mass is derived
assuming HSE, and the gas fraction at directly-observed radii.

\input{Tables/F_gas_obs}

\subsection{Extrapolation of Gas Density Profiles}
\label{sec:Gas.Extrapolation}
As seen above, very few observations retain the necessary sensitivity to
measure the gas density all the way to \rvir{}. Therefore, to
constrain the gas fraction within the entire halo, we can extrapolate
the observed gas mass profile (at \rtwo{} or \rfive{}) to higher
radius by assuming a power-law profile:
\begin{equation}
\rho_{gas}(\textrm{r}) \propto \textrm{r}^{-\alpha_g}, \nonumber
\end{equation}
where $\alpha{}_g$ is the slope of the gas density profile, which can in
general change as radius increases. The total
matter density can be similarly modeled,
\begin{equation}
\rho_{m}(\textrm{r}) \propto \textrm(r)^{-\alpha_{m}}, \nonumber
\end{equation}
with $\alpha{}_m$ the slope of the total mass density profile. At
large radii, the full equation for the gas fraction simplifies to approximately:
\begin{align}
\fg(<\textrm{r}) = \frac{\textrm{M}_{gas}}{\textrm{M}_{tot}} &=
\frac{\int_0^r 4\pi{}r'^2dr'\rho_{gas}(\textrm{r}')}{\int_0^r
  4\pi{}r'^2dr'\rho_{m}(\textrm{r}')} \nonumber \\ & \approx
\frac{\rho_{gas}(\textrm{r})}{\rho_{tot}(\textrm{r})} \nonumber\\ &\propto \textrm{r}^{\alpha_{m} - \alpha_{tot}}. \nonumber
\end{align}
Therefore, the gas fraction can be extrapolated to larger radii using
the difference in slopes between the gas density and total mass
density profiles.

\textbf{\citet{Rasheed2011}} (R11) used this approach to extrapolate
the gas fraction of the G09 cluster samples to \rvir{}. X-ray and SZ
observations show that the gas density decreases more slowly with
radius than the total mass density ($\alpha_{m} > \alpha_{gas}$),
suggesting that the gas fraction should increase when the cluster
outskirts are considered. The authors hoped to place constraints on
the amount of ``missing baryons'' within the virial volume of
clusters.

R11 used a large survey of the literature to recover X-ray
measurements which constrain the gas density slope out to
\rfive{}. These measurements include observations with \Rosat{},
\Chandra, \XMM, and \textit{Suzaku}, and cover a wide range of cluster
masses and temperatures. Averaging over the many observations, the
authors find that the gas density slope at \rfive{} steepens with more
massive clusters, with $\alpha_{gas}$ ranging from $\approx 1.8 \pm
0.2$ for poor clusters (G09 bin 2, $\Mvir \approx 7\power{13}\Msun$)
to $\approx 2.3 \pm 0.02$ for the most massive G09 bin ($\Mvir
\approx9.8\power{14}\Msun$). 

Compared to the gas density profile, the total density (NFW) profile
is significantly steeper in the outer regions of the halo. In the mass
range of the G09 groups and clusters, the NFW profile has a slope of
$\alpha_m = 2.6$ between \rfive{} and \rtwo{}, and steepens to
$\alpha_m = 2.7$ in the region \rtwo{} to \rvir{}. Therefore, R11
predicted that the gas fraction rises significantly above
\rfive{}. Because $\alpha_{gas}$ increases with cluster mass, the gas
fraction is predicted to rise more quickly with radius for groups and
poor clusters ($\fg\propto \textrm{r}^{0.8}$ for G09 bin 2) than for
rich clusters ($\fg \propto \textrm{r}^{0.3}$ for G09 bin 5). For
these two bins, this model predicts increases in \fg{} by a factor of
roughly $1.6$ and $1.2$, respectively, from \rfive{} to \rvir{}. This
offers an explanation for why the missing baryon problem is more
severe in lower-mass clusters: the shallower gas profile implies the
ICM is spread farther out in lower-mass halos than in very massive
ones.

We adopt R11's extrapolation model in order to approximate the gas
fraction at high radius in the samples which do not measure \fg{} to
\rvir{} (all except PC13). $\alpha_{gas}$ for each sample in Table
\ref{tab:F_gas_obs} is taken from the temperature-slope relation in R11,
we do not extrapolate the gas profiles for any individual cluster
sample with coverage beyond \rfive{}. We assume $\alpha_m$ as
above for the NFW profile. We extrapolate \fg{} from the maximum
observed radius, r$_a$, to a larger radius r$_b$ using:
\begin{equation}
\fg(<\textrm{r}_b) =
\fg(<\textrm{r}_a)\left(\frac{\textrm{r}_b}{\textrm{r}_a}\right)^{\alpha_m - \alpha_{gas}}.
\end{equation}
 For example, extrapolating the gas fraction of G09's bin 5 from \rfive{} to \rtwo{}:
\begin{align}
\fg{}(<\rtwo) &=
\fg{}(<\rfive)\left(\frac{\rtwo}{\rfive}\right)^{\alpha_m -
  \alpha_{gas}} \nonumber\\
&\approx .103~(1.45)^{2.6 - 2.3} \nonumber \\
&\approx .115 \nonumber
\end{align}

To calculate the uncertainty on the extrapolated gas fraction, we
propagate the errors in $\fg(<\textrm{r}_a)$ (or $\fg{}_{,a}$) and in
$\alpha_{gas}$, assuming no significant uncertainty exists in
$\alpha_m$ or r$_b$/r$_a$. The fractional errors add in quadrature.
\begin{align}
\frac{\Delta\fg{}_{,b}}{\fg{}_{,b}} &=
\sqrt{\left(\frac{\Delta\fg{}_{,a}}{\fg{}_{,a}}\right)^2 +
  \left(\frac{\Delta\left(\textrm{r}_b/\textrm{r}_a\right)^{\alpha_m-\alpha_{gas}}}{\left(\textrm{r}_b/\textrm{r}_a\right)^{\alpha_m-\alpha_{gas}}}\right)^2}\nonumber\\
\intertext{The uncertainty in the right term is}
\Delta\left(\textrm{r}_b/\textrm{r}_a\right)^{\alpha_m-\alpha_{gas}}
& =
\left(\textrm{r}_b/\textrm{r}_a\right)^{\alpha_m-\alpha_{gas}}\ln{\left(\textrm{r}_b/\textrm{r}_a\right)}\Delta\alpha_{gas}\,,\nonumber\\
\intertext{yielding the final result:}
\frac{\Delta\fg{}_{,b}}{\fg{}_{,b}} &=
\sqrt{\left(\frac{\Delta\fg{}_{,a}}{\fg{}_{,a}}\right)^2 +
  \left(\ln{\left(\textrm{r}_b/\textrm{r}_a\right)}\Delta\alpha_{gas}\right)^2}
\end{align}

The gas density profile is expected to steepen at very large radii,
such that it eventually matches the NFW profile \citeeg{Umetsu2009},
which translates to the gas fraction asymptotically approaching a constant
value. At large enough radius, extrapolation of the gas fraction as
described above will, therefore, become invalid, as $\alpha_{gas}$
will not remain fixed. The range at which the gas density steepens
significantly is not known, however, as observational data does not
currently constrain $\alpha_{gas}$ far beyond \rfive. R11's assumption
that this slope remains constant to \rvir{} is therefore a
questionable one, but no simple alternatives exist. We also assume
$\alpha_{gas}$ remains constant to \rvir{} (and slightly beyond), and
emphasize that the our calculation of the gas fraction will be biased
high if the gas density slope steepens significantly beyond
\rfive{}. In Chapter \ref{chap:Results}, we discuss how our results
may be able to constrain the evolution of this density slope. 

\section{Cluster Stellar Mass Fraction}
\label{sec:Stellar}

The integrated stellar mass of groups and clusters is also an
important (although subdominant) reservoir of baryons in these large
halos. The stellar mass of clusters comes almost entirely from the
stellar content of the individual cluster galaxies.

G09 approximated the stellar content of a large number ($>90$) groups
and clusters from the COSMOS survey. Using optical and infrared
observations from SUBARU, the authors fit a broad-band spectrum to the
detected galaxies in each cluster and used these spectral energy
distributions to derive photometric redshifts for the
sample. Converting the $Ks$-band (IR) luminosity of detected galaxies to stellar
mass, and accounting for the entire predicted galactic mass function,
G09 approximated the stellar fraction in clusters of sizes
$1\power{13}$ -- $1\power{15}$ \Msun. At \rfive{}, the stellar fraction
was found to be significantly higher ($\approx 6\%$) for groups and
poor clusters than for the most massive clusters ($\approx 2\%$). The
authors derived a fit to stellar-fraction versus mass of:
\begin{equation}
\textrm{f}_{*}(<\rfive{}) =
(5.0\pm0.1)\power{-2}~\left(\frac{\Mfive}{5\power{13}\Msun}\right)^{-0.37\pm0.04}~. \nonumber
\end{equation}
This suggested another possible solution to the increased amount of
missing baryons in low-mass halos: the lower fraction of gas could be
offset by a higher fraction of stellar mass. Including both stars and
gas, however, G09 concluded that the baryon fraction of low-mass
clusters still remained below the cosmic fraction ($\approx 12\%$), as
did high-mass clusters ($\approx 14\%$). 

The results of an extensive Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
weak-lensing study of stacked groups and clusters has placed
unparalleled constraints on the stellar fraction in clusters. The
MaxBCG sample \citep{Sheldon2009a} contains $> 130,000$ clusters
between redshifts $z = 0.1-0.3$, was binned by richness and
luminosity, and stacked by centering on the brightest cluster galaxy
(BCG). The mean weak-lensing profile was detected well into the
surrounding large scale structure ($\gsim 15-20 \rvir$), as was the
averaged optical surface brightness \citep{Sheldon2009b}, allowing the
total mass to light ratio (M/L) to be calculated. \citet{Bahcall2014} (BK14)
developed a model for the stellar mass to light ratio of individual
spiral and elliptical galaxies, as well as their relative abundance
from the density-morphology relation, and converted the total mass to
light ratio into the stellar mass fraction. 

Figure \ref{fig:BK14} shows the stellar fraction distributions derived
by BK14.  The stellar fraction is calculated at
$\radius{}_{200b}$\footnote{$\radius{}_{200b}$ represents where the
  density is 200 times the cosmic matter density, not the critical
  density, and corresponds roughly to our definition of \rvir{}.} as a
function of cluster mass. The authors find that the stellar fraction
at fixed radius decreases with halo mass, in excellent agreement with
G09. The stellar fraction is also calculated as a function of radius,
divided into three richness bins, with mass ranges corresponding
roughly to $\Mvir{}< 2\power{13}\Msun$, $2\power{13}\Msun{} < \Mvir{}
< 1\power{14}\Msun{}$, and $1\power{14}\Msun{} < \Mvir{}$. The stellar
fraction decreases significantly from the centers of clusters (where
the light is dominated by the BCG), asymptotically approaching at high
radius a ``cosmic'' stellar fraction of $\textrm{f}_{*} \approx 0.01
\pm 0.004$ in all richness bins. The radius at which the stellar
fraction reaches this cosmic limit decreases with richness class,
suggesting that all clusters contain roughly the same stellar
fraction, but that the stellar mass is more widely distributed in
low-mass clusters with shallow gravitational potentials.

\section{Galaxy Mass Fractions}
\label{sec:Galaxy}

Studying the distribution of baryons in individual galaxies presents
many other challenges not faced in the investigation of
clusters. Because galaxy halos are significantly lower mass than
cluster halos ($\Mvir \approx 1-2\power{12} \Msun{}$ for a typical
L$^*$ galaxy), their gravitational wells are shallower, and it is
easier for feedback effects to remove gas from the systems altogether
\citeeg{Oppenheimer2010}. The lower total mass also translates to a
much lower thermal temperature for the gas to be in hydrostatic
equilibrium. Therefore, the main diffuse gaseous component of galaxy halos
will primarily be too cool and low-density to be detected in
emission. 

The most obvious and easily detected baryon reservoir in (L$^*$)
galaxy halos is the galactic disk itself, which contains the stellar
population and the gas and dust of the ISM. Baryons are also stored
in the ``circumgalactic medium'' (CGM), a large, diffuse region
surrounding galaxies, with low temperatures and
densities. Observations are beginning, for the first time, to place
reasonable constraints on the total mass in this baryonic phase,
allowing estimates of the makeup, distribution, and total fraction of
baryons in the low-mass halos of galaxies. 

\subsection{The Circumgalactic Medium}
\label{sec:Galaxy.CGM}

The existence of the CGM was first predicted by \citet{Bahcall1969} to
explain the presence of absorption features in the spectra of
quasars. The emission from quasars was known to come from high
redshift, while the absorption lines came from lower redshifts
(typically $z = 1-3$), had low dispersion velocities, and showed the
presence of many abundant elements and ionization states (including
absorption from HI, CII, CIV, SiII, and many others). The authors
predicted that an extended halo of gas ($\radius{} \approx 10^2$ kpc)
surrounding normal galaxies ($\Mass{} \approx 10^{11}-10^{12}$ \Msun)
could produce the observed absorption profiles and dispersion
velocities. Even at this early stage, many separate phases of the CGM
were predicted, as temperatures ranging from $2\power{4} - 2\power{5}$
$^\circ{}$K were required to explain the variety of ionization states.

Subsequent observations have confirmed this hypothesis by associating
the absorption features in QSO sightlines to nearby foreground
galaxies with the expected redshifts. The CGM is a gaseous reservoir
in the dark matter halo around galaxies, which extends for several
hundred kiloparsecs, and likely as far as the virial radius
($\rvir{}\approx 300$ kpc for an L$^*$ galaxy). The CGM is also likely
the major source of pristine gas accreting onto the galactic disk. 

The use of QSO and galaxy absorption spectroscopy remains the most
powerful tool in statistically characterizing the CGM. The high
spatial density of background galaxies and quasars results in a large
number of sightlines through the CGM at a wide variety of projected
distances. While it is nearly impossible to have enough bright
background sources to resolve the distribution of the CGM in any
individual galaxy, it is possible to recover the average profile of
gas absorption as a function of radius by stacking many sightlines
together by their projected distance from the host galaxy.

\textbf{\citet{Steidel2010}} used a sample of 512 galaxy pairs, where
both foreground and background galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts
and are separated by less than 15" on the sky. At the median redshift
of the foreground absorbers ($z\approx 2$), this translates to
projected distances within 125 kpc. Absorption profiles (stacked into
three projected radius bins) were measured for Ly$\alpha$, CIV
(1549\AA), CII (1334\AA), SiIV (1393\AA), and SiII(1260\AA and
1526\AA). Hydrogen, the most dominant element by mass in the CGM, is
measured in its neutral phase through Ly$\alpha$ absorption, an is
observed well beyond 100 kpc. Using an approximate model for
populating the CGM by galactic outflows, the authors place a rough
constraint on the CGM mass of $\Mass{}_{CGM} \approx 3\power{10}
\Msun{}$. By this approximation, the CGM contains roughly the same
mass content as the combination of stars and gas in the stellar disk,
and amounts to $\approx 3-4\%$ of the total mass of the dark matter
halo ($\approx 20\%$ of the expected baryonic mass, assuming the halo
contains the entire cosmic baryon fraction).

The COS-Halos survey \citep{Tumlinson2011} was designed specifically
to study the CGM in low-redshift galaxies. It uses far-UV spectroscopy
of background quasars behind 44 roughly L$^*$ galaxies, observed with
the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph instrument on the Hubble Space
Telescope. Measuring the column density in Ly$\alpha$, early results
\citep{Thom2012,Werk2013} placed a very conservative lower limit on
the CGM gas mass of $\Mass{}_{CGM} > 10^9 \Msun{}$. Later analysis by
\textbf{\citet{Werk2014}} (W14) developed a model for the ionization
state of the CGM, constrained by the observed absorption of low,
intermediate, and high-ionization transitions in metals. This model --
which indicates that the hydrogen in the CGM is increasingly ionized
at higher radii -- is used to greatly improve the limits on the CGM
mass. Integrating their best-fit gas density profile to the virial
radius (300 kpc), they find that the cool phase (T $\approx 10^4 -
10^5$ K) of the CGM in L$^*$ galaxies has a mass of $\Mass{}_{CGM}
\approx 9.5\power{10}$ \Msun{}. This CGM mass is consistent with the
rough estimate made by \citet{Steidel2010}, and is similar to the
combined mass of the stellar disk and ISM. The uncertainty in
$\Mass{}_{CGM}$ is dominated by saturation in the HI absorption
profiles. The minimum CGM mass is $\Mass{}_{CGM} > 6.5\power{10}
\Msun$, and could range as high as $\Mass{}_{CGM} \approx
1.2\power{11} \Msun{}$ if all saturated column densities are 3 times
higher than their lower limits. The total halo mass of L$^*$ galaxies
is approximately $1.6\power{12}\Msun{}$, so the authors conclude the
CGM accounts for $25-46\%$ of the expected baryonic mass in galaxies
($\Mass{}_{b} = \fb{}_{,cosmic} \Mvir{} \approx 2.6\power{11}
\Msun{}$).

\subsection{Estimate of The Galactic-Halo Baryon Fraction}
\label{sec:Galaxy.Fraction}

\citet{Werk2014} combined their estimate of the cool gas mass in the
CGM with observations of other baryonic components of galactic halos
to constrain the total baryon fraction currently detected within the
virial radius. The median stellar mass of the COS-Halos galaxies is
$\left<\Mass{}_*\right> = 4\power{10}\Msun$, in agreement with
abundance matching estimates \citep{Behroozi2010}. The gaseous
component of the ISM, observed with HI surveys, can vary from very
little (for elliptical galaxies) to of order the stellar mass
\citep{McGaugh2010, Martin2010}. Together, for a star-forming L$^*$
galaxy, the mass of the stellar disk (the normal galactic component)
is given as $7\power{10}\Msun{}$. Thus, the disk contributes about $4-5\%$
of the total mass of the galactic halo, or about $27\%$ of the
expected baryon content. 

The presence of high-ionization absorption lines in CGM profiles
suggests that a warm CGM component exists. The ionization model
derived by W14 to fit the low-ionization transition
abundances severely underestimates the column density of OVI. The
authors cite halo models which predict a mass of warm CGM of at least
$\Mass_{CGM, warm} \gsim 10^10\Msun{}$ to explain the observed OVI
absorption \citep{Peeples2014}. This mass estimate is highly sensitive
to the assumed metallicity in the warm CGM phase, and decreasing Z
from Z$_\odot$ to $0.1$Z$_\odot$ increases the predicted warm CGM mass
by a factor of 10. The constraints on the warm CGM fraction thus range
from $0.6\%$ to $6\%$ of the total halo mass, or $4-40\%$ of the
expected baryon fraction. 

X-ray observations hint at the existence of a diffuse X-ray emitting
reservoir outside large galaxies. Estimates of the total mass of this
X-ray component range from $10^9 - 10^{10}$ \Msun{}. W14 argues that,
by extrapolating the observed mass of $\approx 510^9\Msun{}$, observed
within 50 kpc of an L$^*$ galaxy by \Rosat{} \citep{Anderson2013}, to
300 kpc could increase the mass by a factor of $6-14$, although the
density profile of this X-ray component is unconstrained. W14 adopts
the range of $10^9 - 1.4\power{10}\Msun{}$ for the X-ray CGM from this
work. This is between $\approx 1\%$ to $5\%$ of the expected baryonic
mass, or $<1\%$ of the total mass budget. \citet{Gupta2012}, however,
claims that the Milky Way may have a hot, X-ray reservoir with mass as
high as $>10^{11}\Msun{}$, based on OVII absorption observed with
\XMM{} and emission from the soft X-ray background. If this is true,
the X-ray component of the CGM may be substantially larger than
observed by \citet{Anderson2013}. 

Allow us to summarize the above distribution of the expected baryonic
mass ($\approx 2.6\power{11}\Msun{}$) in galaxy halos, as outlined in
\citet{Werk2014}. The gas in the cool CGM has at least $25\%$ and as
much as $50\%$ of $\Mass{}_{b}$. The stellar disk contains
$\approx25\%$, depending on the amount of gas in the ISM. The warm CGM
contains between $4\%$ and $40\%$, and the X-ray CGM is thought to
hold $1\% - 5\%$. W14 concludes that current observations could be
detecting the entire baryon fraction in galactic clusters, with the
primary uncertainty resting on the contents of the warm CGM.
