\caption{The cumulative hot gas fraction for each cluster sample in
  our study, plotted against the cluster-centric radius. Blue, red,
  and green points represent data from \citet{Rasheed2011},
  \citet{Eckert2013a}, and \citet{PlanckIntVb}, respectively. See text
  for details of these sources. The ``expected hot gas'' line is as in
  Fig \ref{fig:FgvM}.}
