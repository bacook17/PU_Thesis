\caption{The dependence of $\fg(<\rfive)$ on \Mfive{} ($\sim
0.73\Mvir$), as presented in \citet{Giodini2009}. The light-grey
  points represent individual group/cluster observations from
  \citet{Vikhlinin2006}, \citet{Arnaud2007}, and \citet{Sun2009},
  while the dark points are the average gas fractions, binned
  logarithmically with mass. Lower-mass halos show significantly lower
gas fractions, with $\fg(<\rfive)$ scaling roughly as
$\Mfive^{0.21}$. }
