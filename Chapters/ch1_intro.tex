\section{The Cosmic Baryon Fraction}
\label{s.BaryonFraction}
In the beginning, there was the big bang. All of the contributions to
the cosmic energy budget -- all of the forms that matter and energy
take today -- originated around 13.8 billion years ago, when the
universe was unimaginably hot and dense. Various
mechanisms\footnote{most notably the theory of inflation, which will
  surely see a dramatic increase in interest since the detections of
  B-mode polarization in the CMB \citep{BICEP22014}.} have been
offered to explain the genesis of the energy-filled, rapidly expanding
universe which appeared in the briefest fraction of a second after the
big bang. As the universe expanded and cooled, the available energy
distributed itself into various different forms, eventually settling
down into the primary energy components we observe today, including
radiation (photons and neutrinos), baryons (``ordinary'' matter,
comprised of protons, neutrons, and electrons), as well as the
mysterious dark matter and dark energy. 

Energy did not populate these forms in equal proportions; the energy
densities of each population differed by many orders of magnitude,
initially, and their ratios changed continually throughout the
expansion history of the universe. Radiation density -- primarily the
photon density ($\rho_\gamma$), dominant in the earliest periods after
the big bang -- diluted quickly from the combination of expansionary
volume increase and Doppler redshifting. The matter density --
$\rho_m$, comprised of both baryons ($\rho_b$) and cold dark matter
($\rho_c$) -- was initially only a miniscule portion of the cosmic
energy budget, but eventually matter dominated the cosmic scene after
expansion ``cooled'' the photon temperature significantly. Buried far
below the other components originally, dark energy -- $\rho_\nu$,
commonly believed to be a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ -- retains a
constant energy density while the universe expands, becoming dominant
at late times when \rhom
