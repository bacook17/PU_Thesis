\label{chap:Conclusions}

In this thesis, we present a synthesis of observational constraints on
the distribution and abundance of baryons in dark matter halos over a
wide range of masses. Baryons, while only $16\%$ of the total mass in
the universe, are the most easily detectable form of matter and are
incredibly important tools in understanding and observing the
formation of structure and dark matter halos in the universe. Previous
observations suggest halos are deficient in baryons relative to the
cosmic fraction, a discrepancy known as the ``Missing Baryon
Problem''. We trace the baryon distribution in halos from galactic
scales ($\Mvir{} = 10^{12}~\Msun$) to groups ($\Mvir{}=10^{13}~\Msun$),
and clusters ($\Mvir{} = 10^{14}\dash10^{15}~\Msun$) to address the missing
baryon problem and to obtain a global picture of the distribution of
baryons relative to dark matter in the universe. 

Our group and cluster gas mass data is comprised of a collection of
X-ray and SZ measurements of the gas density, temperature, and
pressure profiles in the ICM. The total mass is derived either through
the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium or by using weak
lensing. When the gas fraction is not measured to the virial radius,
we extrapolate the observed gas fraction using gas density profile
slopes appropriate to the given halo mass or ICM temperature
\citep{Rasheed2011}. Our galaxy cluster data comes from a compilation
by \citet{Werk2014}, and includes absorption measurements of the
multiphase CGM, stellar masses, and ISM masses from HI surveys.

Our main results are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Although the gas fraction within \rfive{} in clusters is
  significantly lower than the cosmic baryon fraction, the gas
  distribution is less centrally concentrated than dark matter, such
  that the gas fraction increases significantly when integrated to the
  cluster outskirts.
\item The gaseous ICM is more extended in low-mass halos, explaining
  why the gas fraction is observed to be particularly low within
  \rfive{} in these halos. The gas fraction rises more steeply in
  groups and poor clusters than in massive clusters, and our
  extrapolations predict that the gas fraction of all groups and
  clusters should converge to the cosmic value near \rvir{}.
\item The cluster stellar fraction at any given radius is higher in
  groups and poor clusters, although in clusters of all sizes the
  fraction asymptotically approaches the ``cosmic'' stellar fraction
  $0.01\pm0.004$ at high enough radius. 
\item Observational constraints on the gas content of galactic halos
  find the cool CGM can account for $25-50\%$ of the total baryonic
  mass. Current constraints of the stellar disk, ISM, and multiphase
  CGM are consistent with the galactic baryon fraction matching the
  cosmic value within the viral radius of L$^*$ galaxies.
\item Combining the observed baryonic components of galaxy, group, and
  cluster halos, we show that dark matter halos contain the cosmic
  fraction of baryons within approximately the virial radius, across
  three orders of magnitude in halo mass. 
\item The baryonic distribution of halos is not entirely
  self-similar. Baryons in less-massive halos are pushed farther into
  the outskirts of the shallow gravitational well by feedback
  mechanisms, not reaching the
  cosmic fraction until higher radii. The abundance of different
  baryonic components (particularly stellar mass and gas) also changes
  with cluster mass.
\item The consistent baryon fraction in galactic and cluster halos
  suggests that cluster dark matter and baryonic masses could be
  composed entirely of matter originally in galactic halos which fell
  into cluster halos. Using the ratio of stellar fractions, we
  show that galactic halos contribute \textbf{no less than $40\%$} of
  the total matter of clusters. 
\item The baryon distribution of the universe traces the dark matter
  distribution well, with no need for additional unseen or unbound
  reservoirs of baryons from halos. Averaged over scales larger than
  the virial radius, baryons map the total structure of the universe,
  and the baryonic mass of clusters is an effective proxy for the
  total mass.
\end{enumerate}

Improvements on the precision of our results will come from better
constraints of the ICM temperature profile at high radius (in
clusters) and of the mass in the warm CGM phase (in
galaxies). Additionally, further weak lensing calibrations are
required to constrain the magnitude of the hydrostatic equilibrium
bias on the total cluster mass. 

The baryonic content of the universe, while energetically small, is
what makes up all physical objects we observe; it drives astrophysical
phenomena such as nucleosynthesis, chemistry, and planetary formation,
and is what eventually gave rise to life. Yet, until recently, baryons
have been overshadowed by dark matter as tools for studying cosmology
of the low-redshift universe and the growth of large-scale
structure. Our results show that the baryon distribution is an
excellent proxy for the dark matter distribution, and represents a new
way of approaching the growth and evolution of halos and structure in
the universe.
