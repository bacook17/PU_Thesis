\caption{The cumulative hot gas fraction for each cluster sample in
  our study, plotted against the mean halo mass. Blue circles, green
  diamonds, and red squares show the gas fraction measured at
  r$_{500}$, r$_{200}$, and r$_{vir}$, respectively. The ``f$_{gas}$''
  line represents roughly the expected hot-gas fraction, and is the
  the difference between the WMAP9 cosmic baryon fraction and the
  cosmic stellar fraction \citep[$\sim{}1\%$,][]{Bahcall2014}.}
