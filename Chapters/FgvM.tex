\caption{The cumulative hot gas fraction for each cluster sample in
  our study, plotted against the mean halo mass. Blue circles, green
  diamonds, and red squares show the gas fraction measured at
  r$_{500}$, r$_{200}$, and r$_{vir}$, respectively. The ``expected
  hot gas'' line represents is the difference between the WMAP9 cosmic
  baryon fraction and the cosmic stellar fraction
  \citep{Bahcall2014}.}
