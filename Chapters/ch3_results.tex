\section{The Distribution of Gas and Baryons in Clusters}
\label{sec:Spatial}

Using the observations presented in Chapter \ref{chap:Data}, we have
measurements of the gaseous component of the ICM in halos spanning the
entire mass range from poor groups to the most massive clusters. In
Figure \ref{fig:FgvR}, we present the gas fraction in these groups and
clusters as a function of radius, out to $1.2\rvir{}$. We using the
extrapolation methods described in Section \ref{sec:Gas.Extrapolation}
when necessary for observations which only constrain the gas fraction
within \rfive{} and \rtwo{}. 

\input{Figures/FgvR}

The gas fraction increases with radius in all groups and
clusters. Comparing to the ``expected'' gas fraction of $\approx
15.4\%$, which is the difference between the WMAP9 cosmic baryon
fraction ($16.4\%$) and the cosmic stellar fraction of BK14 ($1\%$),
nearly all groups appear to contain the expected fraction of gas
within the virial radius, or slightly beyond. The gas fractions of
each sample (both observed and extrapolated) are listed in Table
\ref{tab:F_gas_all}.

Figure \ref{fig:FgvM} shows the halo gas fraction as a function of the
virial mass of the halo.
