\caption{A comparison of weak lensing masses ($\Mass{}^{WL}_{500c}$)
  and X-ray hydrostatic masses ($\Mass{}^{X}_{500c}$) for SZ clusters,
  as presented in \citet{Gruen2013}. Error bars indicate the best-fit
  ``single-halo'' fit, while the filled symbols include corrections to
  $\Mass^{WL}$ for other structures in the field of view. In tension
  with simulations, the authors find that hydrostatic masses are not
  systematically biased low relative to the weak lensing mass.}
