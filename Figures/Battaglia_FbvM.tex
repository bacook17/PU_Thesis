\caption{The gas, stellar, and baryon fraction (scaled by the cosmic
  baryon fraction) as a function of cluster mass from a series of
  simulations by \citet{Battaglia2013}. The baryon fraction within
  \rtwo{} is close to the cosmic value for the entire mass range of
  $10^{14}\dash10^{15}~\Msun{}$, except for in the AGN feedback model,
  where low-mass clusters have fewer baryons within \rtwo{}. These
  simulations are in agreement with our results, although the
  simulations predict a large hydrostatic mass bias (Section
  \ref{sec:Limitations.HSE}) that has yet to be confirmed observationally.}
