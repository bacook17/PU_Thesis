\caption{The variation in the CMB power spectrum's acoustic peaks due
  to variations in cosmic abundance parameters. The thick black line
  represents a fiducial universe with $\omegam h^2 = 0.16$, $\omegab
  h^2 = 0.021$, and $\omegal = 0.7$. Other lines represent the results
  from changes to these parameters, notably an increase in peak height
  and rightward shift of peaks ($\Delta l > 0$) with an increase in
  $\omegab h^2$. A decrease in $\omegam h^2$ has similar (but
  distinguishable) effects. Figure from \citet[][Fig.~8.19]{Dodelson2003}.}
