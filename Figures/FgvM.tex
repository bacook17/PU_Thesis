\caption{The cumulative hot gas fraction for each cluster sample in
  our study, plotted against the mean halo mass. Blue circles, green
  diamonds, red squares, and yellow hexagons show the gas fraction
  measured at r$_{500}$, r$_{200}$, r$_{vir}$, and $1.2\rvir$,
  respectively. The f$_{gas}$ line represents roughly the expected
  hot-gas fraction, and is the the difference between the \WMAP9
  cosmic baryon fraction and the cosmic stellar fraction
  \citep[$\sim{}1\%$,][]{Bahcall2014}.}
