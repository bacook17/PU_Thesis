\caption{The gas, stellar, and baryon fraction distributions (scaled
  by the cosmic baryon fraction) as a function of radius in the
  simulations of \citet{Battaglia2013}, binned in four parts by
  cluster mass. The stellar fraction and gas profiles match
  observations well, and the total baryon fraction approaches the
  cosmic value at high radius.}
