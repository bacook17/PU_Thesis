\caption{The problem of missing baryons, relative to mass, in groups
  and clusters. \textit{Upper}: shows the total baryon fraction within
  \rfive{} for groups and clusters binned by mass. The dark grey
  stripe represents the cosmic baryon fraction. All clusters are short
  of baryons, but low-mass systems are particularly
  deficient. \textit{Lower}: the gas and stellar fractions of the mass
  bins. Figure from \citet{Giodini2009}.}
