\caption{The cumulative stellar (Figure \ref{fig:BK14}) and hot gas
  (Figure \ref{fig:FgvR}) fractions for groups and clusters, as a
  function of cluster-centric radius. \citet{Bahcall2014} presented
  the stellar fraction for various cluster richness bins. The gas
  fractions of Figure \ref{fig:FgvR} have been sorted into
  corresponding bins, using the mass-richness relation of
  \citet{Sheldon2009b}. The stellar fraction asymptotes to a
  ``cosmic'' stellar fraction at a few times $\rvir$, and the gas
  fraction increases and converges at high radius as well.}
