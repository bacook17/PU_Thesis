\caption{The gas fraction (scaled by the cosmic baryon fraction)
  within various radii, as a function of redshift, as measured by the
  simulations of \citet{Battaglia2013}, and binned by mass. There is
  no significant redshift evolution of the gas fraction within any
  given radius, except possibly within $2\rtwo{}$, suggesting that
  measurements of the cluster baryon fraction should be fairly
  redshift independent back to $z\approx1$, where massive clusters
  first begin to form.}
