\caption{The cumulative baryon fraction for groups and clusters, as a
  function of cluster-centric radius. The baryon fraction (f$_b$) is
  the sum of the cumulative stellar fraction and the cumulative hot
  gas fraction of Figure \ref{fig:FxvR}. Green squares represent the
  averaged fractions of groups and smaller clusters, while blue
  circles represent larger clutsers. The baryon fraction in large
  clusters appears to approach the cosmic fraction at large scales,
  and we extrapolate the value at larger scales as the value at
  $1.2\rvir{}$, an assumption we discuss in Section \ref{sec:Limitations.Slope}.}
